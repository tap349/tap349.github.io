dependencies vs. development dependencies
-----------------------------------------

install package as dependency:

```sh
$ npm install <package> --save
```

install package as development dependency:

```sh
$ npm install <package> --save-dev
```

dependencies:

- added to `dependencies` section of _package.json_
- application cannot run without it
- transitive dependencies are installed

  dependencies of your dependencies are installed recursively when you run
  `npm install`.

development dependencies:

- added to `devDependencies` section of _package.json_
- packages are used in development environment only (say, Babel or Flow)
- transitive development dependencies are not installed

  that is if you install some package `foo` and it has its own development
  dependencies, they are not installed when you run `npm install`.

peer dependencies

don't use peer dependencies if you are not npm package author - they are not
automatically installed by npm (since version 3):
