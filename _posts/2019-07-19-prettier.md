## troubleshooting

### MacVim generates `*:p` artifacts in project root directory

```
$ ls -al
...
-rw-r--r--    1 tap  staff    7598 Jul 19 15:14 11:p
-rw-r--r--    1 tap  staff    9643 Jul 19 15:14 9:p
```

they are generated sporadically - I haven't found any pattern.

**solution**

most likely these are backup files generated by Vim and they have something to
do with Prettier (because they appeared right after I started to use Prettier)
but their file names are not expanded for some reason:

```vim
" ~/.vim/autocommands.vim

function! s:SetBackupDir()
  let l:backupdir = $HOME . '/.vim/backup/' . expand('%:p:h')
  " ...
endfunction
```

it may happen because 2 backup files are written to disk almost simultaneously:

- first backup of original file is written
- then original file is formatted with Prettier and its backup is written too

my guess is Vim cannot handle this situation properly - hence the artifacts.

my current (temporary) solution is to disable backups completely:

```diff
  " ~/.vim/vimrc

- set backup
+ set nobackup
```
