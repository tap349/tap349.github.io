* TOC
{:toc}
<hr>

- use blockquotes for quotations and current page titles (say, wizard steps):

  > 1) Step 1: Create Policy

  NOTE: quotation marks are not used.

- use table row to specify path/location (within a web page or program):

  | iTunes Connect: `My Apps` → `<my_app>` → `Features` (tab)

  NOTE: quotation marks are used for exact names.
  NOTE: keep text on a single line (or else table won't be rendered).

- when location/path is inlined, don't wrap it in table:

  create sandbox tester (test user): `Sandbox Testers` (tab) → `Testers ⨁`
