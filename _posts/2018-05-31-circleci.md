SSH config is not available on CI/CD server (unless you copy it explicitly) =>
use IP address instead of SSH config entry name to specify hostname:

- when adding your private key in project settings on CircleCI
- in deploy config of your application (say, _.deliver/config_ or
  _config/deploy/production.rb_)

caching
-------

1. <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching>

cache archives are uploaded to external storage and are available across
different containers (say, you can save cache in build job and restore it
later in deploy job - jobs are using separate Docker containers).

### partial cache restoration

CircleCI 2.0 caching finally clicked with me after reading this comment:

{% raw %}
> <https://discuss.circleci.com/t/circle-2-0-caching-is-too-limited-to-be-very-useful/11694/2>
>
> ```yaml
> - restore_cache:
>     keys:
>       - projectname-npm-deps-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
>       - projectname-npm-deps-{{ .Branch }}
>       - projectname-npm-deps-
> ```
>
> After the restore_cache step above you run npm install and npm will ‘fill in
> the gaps’. So let’s say we were only able to restore the last (least specific)
> cache above - it’s likely that most of your dependencies will be similar and
> npm install will figure out what else needs installing.
{% endraw %}

### cache invalidation

say, we have these keys in `restore_cache` and `save_cache` steps:

{% raw %}
```yaml
- restore_cache:
    keys:
      - v1-mix-cache-{{ checksum "mix.lock" }}
      - v1-mix-cache-{{ .Branch }}
      - v1-mix-cache

# ...

- save_cache:
    key: v1-mix-cache-{{ checksum "mix.lock" }}
    paths: deps
- save_cache:
    key: v1-mix-cache-{{ .Branch }}
    paths: deps
- save_cache:
    key: v1-mix-cache
    paths: deps
```
{% endraw %}

existing caches are **NEVER** updated or invalidated!

say, _mix.lock_ is updated and its checksum is changed.

- `restore_cache` step

  CircleCI expands templates in all specified keys and tries to find existing
  keys (that is keys stored somewhere in its internal KV store). the 2nd and
  the 3rd cache keys are found (checksum has changed, branch stays the same,
  the 3rd key always matches unless you increment a version prefix). then the
  most recently generated cache is restored and used - not the cache under the
  most specific matching key (though it's highly likely that the most recently
  generated cache is stored under the most specific matching key).

- `save_cache` step

  CircleCI expands templates in all `save_cache` keys and saves current cache
  under all NEW cache keys (that is keys which are not present in KV store) -
  this is the 1st key only since only checksum has changed. if, say, not only
  is _mix.lock_ updated but branch is switched as well, current cache will be
  saved under both the 1st and the 2nd cache keys.

troubleshooting
---------------

### build is not starting after changes are pushed to GitHub

**solution**

there was an error in my CircleCI config - `version: 2` key was missing in
`workflows` section.

I have found this error by clicking project name (or else it's possible to
click any branch of the project):

| CircleCI: `BUILDS` (left menu) → `<project_name>` (link)

you'll see a big yellow `NEEDS SETUP` button if there are any config errors.

### /bin/bash: yarn: command not found

**solution**

pre-built CircleCI Docker image `circleci/ruby:2.5.1` doesn't have Yarn
preinstalled - use `-node` image variant instead:

> <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/yarn/#using-yarn-in-circleci>
>
> If you are using one of the other language images such as circleci/python
> or circleci/ruby, there are two image variants that will include Yarn as
> well as NodeJS. These would be the -node and -node-browsers image variants.

### [Rails] Rails.application.credentials are empty in Rails 5.2+

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48935168/handle-credentials-in-circleci-rails-app>

Rails 5.2 uses encrypted _config/credentials.yml.enc_ to store credentials and
_config/master.key_ to decrypt it but the latter is not available on CircleCI.

it's possible to store master key in `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable:

> <http://guides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html#encrypted-secrets>
>
> Secrets will be decrypted in production, using a key stored either in the
> RAILS_MASTER_KEY environment variable, or in a key file.

| CircleCI: Project Settings → `BUILD SETTINGS` (section) → `Environment Variables`

### deploy job prompts for deploy user password

**solution**

1. <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#add_ssh_keys>
2. <https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015628247-Are-you-sure-you-want-to-continue-connecting-yes-no->

I haven't added my private SSH key:

| CircleCI: Project Settings → `PERMISSIONS` (section) → `SSH permissions`
| `Add SSH key` (button)

- `Hostname` (input): production server IP
- `Private Key` (textarea): contents of your _~/.ssh/id_rsa_

after SSH key is added, you'll see its fingerprint - use it to add SSH key in
`add_ssh_keys` step of `deploy` job in CircleCI config:

```diff
  # .circleci/config.yml

  jobs:
    deploy:
      steps:
        - checkout
+       - add_ssh_keys:
+           fingerprints:
+             - '21:cd:07:a3:b8:b9:1f:20:b0:eb:59:c7:e3:14:fc:5e'
```

NOTE: it's possible not to specify which SSH keys to use (via fingerprints)
      explicitly in CircleCI config - by default all added SSH keys will be
      loaded:

> <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#add_ssh_keys>
>
> Note that CircleCI 2.0 jobs are auto configured with ssh-agent with all keys
> auto-loaded, and is sufficient for most cases. add_ssh_keys may be needed to
> have greater control over which SSH keys to authenticate

### [Phoenix] test.secret.exs is missing on CircleCI

by default _config/test.secret.exs_ is added to _.gitignore_ and consequently
ignored by Git (untracked). still it's imported in _config/test.exs_:

```elixir
# config/test.exs

import_config "test.secret.exs"
```

as a result it's not found on CircleCI:

```
$ #!/bin/bash -eo pipefail
  mix local.hex --if-missing --force
** (Code.LoadError) could not load /home/circleci/app/config/test.secret.exs
```

**solution**

1. <https://www.viget.com/articles/how-to-setup-elixir-for-circleci-success/>

- create a separate _config/test.secret.exs.circleci_

  this file shouldn't contain any sensitive information but database
  credentials only:

  ```elixir
  # config/test.secret.exs.circleci

  use Mix.Config

  config :lain, Lain.Repo,
    username: "lain_test",
    password: "lain_test",
    database: "lain_test",
    hostname: "localhost",
    pool_size: 10,
    pool: Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox
  ```

  _config/test.secret.exs.circleci_ can be safely added to Git repo and
  pushed to GitHub.

- copy it to _config/test.secret.exs_ on CircleCI

  _config/test.secret.exs_ must be created right after `checkout` step in
  both `build` and `deploy` jobs:

  ```diff
    # .circleci/config.yml

    version: 2
    jobs:
      build:
        # ...

        steps:
          - checkout

  +       # -------------------------------------------------------------
  +       # Create test.secret.exs
  +       # -------------------------------------------------------------
  +
  +       - run: cp config/test.secret.exs{.circleci,}
  +
          # ...

      deploy:
        # ...

        steps:
          - checkout

  +       # -------------------------------------------------------------
  +       # Create test.secret.exs
  +       # -------------------------------------------------------------
  +
  +       - run: cp config/test.secret.exs{.circleci,}
  +
          # ...
  ```

### [Phoenix] build cache from build stage is not used in deploy stage

**solution**

it has turned out I use different Mix environments in build and deploy stages
so the cache from the former is of no use for the latter.

there might be 2 solutions:

1. use the same Mix environment (`MIX_ENV` environment variable) in both stages
2. save cache in both stages (currently I don't save cache in deploy stage)

### [Rails] Unable to fetch some archives

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Install psql
          command: sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

`Install psql` step log:

```

```

**solution**

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run:
          # or else postgresql-client package is not found
          name: Update package list
          command: sudo apt-get update

      - run:

### You must use Bundler 2 or greater with this lockfile.

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Bundle install
          command: bundle install --jobs=4 --retry=3 --path vendor/bundle
```

`Bundle install` step log:

```
You must use Bundler 2 or greater with this lockfile.
```

**solution**

1. <https://discuss.circleci.com/t/using-bundler-2-0-during-ci-fails/27411/2>

```diff
  # .circleci/config.yml

  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.0
+         environment:
+           BUNDLER_VERSION: 2.0.1

+     steps:
+       - run:
+           name: Update bundler
+           command: gem update bundler
+
        - run:
            name: Bundle install
            command: bundle install --jobs=4 --retry=3 --path vendor/bundle

    deploy:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.0
+         environment:
+           BUNDLER_VERSION: 2.0.1
```
