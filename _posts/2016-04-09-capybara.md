## what is Capybara

Capybara:

- just an API that provides a layer of abstraction on top of
  actual automation library (driver) - like Selenium WebDriver
- written in ruby
- supports testing web applications written in many languages and frameworks
  (though originally was created for testing Rails applications)
- provides DSL for test automation
- allows to write tests once and run them in any compatible driver
- has built-in drivers - additional drivers are available as gems
- handles asynchronous JS without the user even noticing
