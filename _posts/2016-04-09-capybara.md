## about

key benefits:

- no setup (works out of the box for Rails and Rack applications)
- intuitive API (mimics user language)
- switch backends without changes to tests
- no need to manually wait for async process to complete

Capybara:

- is just an API that provides a layer of abstraction on top of
  actual automation library (driver) - like Selenium WebDriver
- is written in ruby
- supports testing web applications written in many languages and frameworks
  (though originally was created for testing Rails applications)
- provides DSL for test automation
- allows to write tests once and run them in any compatible driver
- has built-in drivers - additional drivers are available as gems
- handles asynchronous JS without the user even noticing

## installation

_Gemfile_:

```ruby
gem 'capybara'
```

_rails_helper.rb_ (not required indeed):

```ruby
require 'capybara/rails'
```

## RSpec integration

_rails_helper.rb_ (not required indeed):

```ruby
require 'capybara/rspec'
```

RSpec can be configured to infer spec type from a file location (Rails only):

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
end
```

in this case all specs in _spec/features/_ have type `feature` automatically
(Capybara specs).

or else just tag example groups with `type: :feature` manually
if file location is different.

## drivers

### using JS driver

use `js: true` (or just `:js` when there are no other options) option
to switch to JS driver (`selenium` by default).

### switching drivers

- set default driver globally in _rails_helper.rb_:

  ```ruby
  Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
  # default JS driver - when `js: true` is used
  Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
  ```

- set current driver temporarily in before/after blocks:

  ```ruby
  Capybara.current_driver = :webkit # before block
  Capybara.use_default_driver       # after block
  ```

- set driver for specific test using `driver` option:

  ```ruby
  describe 'some stuff which requires js', js: true do
    it 'will use the default js driver'
    it 'will switch to one specific driver', driver: :webkit
  end
  ```

switching driver creates a new session -
you may not be able to switch in the middle of a test.

### driver types

headless drivers don't require display server (X11, Xvfb, etc.) -
all drivers mentioned below except Selenium are headless.

#### RackTest

- default driver (`rack_test`) - fast but limited
- doesn't support executing JS
- headless driver
- directly interacts with Rack interfaces -
  doesn't require a server to be started
- can be used with Rack applications only
- cannot access HTTP resources outside of Rack app
  (e.g., redirects to external sites, external APIs)

for RSpec it's better to have RackTest as default driver and
mark tests that require JS support with `js: true` to use default JS driver.

#### [Selenium](https://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver)

- `selenium-webdriver` gem
- `Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium`
- supports executing JS
- not headless driver (by default uses Firefox - the latter must be installed)

install `chromedriver` to use Selenium with Chrome browser
(see [below](#customizing-drivers) on how to change browser for Selenium):

```sh
$ brew install chromedriver
```

#### [Capybara-webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit)

- `capybara-webkit` gem
- `Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium`
- supports executing JS
- not pure headless driver (still relies on X11 being present in Linux)
- wraps QtWebKit
- requires Qt system libraries:

  ```sh
  $ brew install qt
  ```

#### [Poltergeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist)

- `poltergeist` gem
- `Capybara.javascript_driver = :poltergeist`
- supports executing JS
- pure headless driver (no need for X11)
- wraps PhantomJS (uses QtWebKit but makes it purely headless)
- requires PhantomJS (installs QtWebKit as dependency):

  ```sh
  $ brew install phantomjs
  ```

require `capybara/poltergeist` in _rails_helper.rb_ to use it.

### customizing drivers

Capybara allows to override standard driver configuration:

```ruby
Capybara.register_driver :selenium do |app|
  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: :chrome)
end
```

or register customized standard driver as a new driver:

```ruby
Capybara.register_driver :selenium_chrome do |app|
  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: :chrome)
end
```

now it's possible to use `selenium_chrome` driver
whenever you would use a standard driver.

## DSL

- by default Capybara will only locate visible elements
- all searches are case-sensitive (because XPath is case-sensitive)

### RSpec method aliases

Capybara alias   | RSpec method
-----------------|-------------------------------
`feature`        | `describe ..., type: :feature`
`background`     | `before`
`scenario`       | `it`
`given`/`given!` |  `let`/`let!`

### finding elements

precedence of locators (attributes or texts) elements are found by:

locator    | element
-----------|--------------------------------------------------------
name       | inputs (file, checkbox, radio, text), textarea, select
id         | all
value      | inputs (submit, reset, image, button), button
label text | inputs (file, checkbox, radio, text), select
text       | button, link, select option
title      | inputs (submit, reset, image, button), button, link

only generic methods (`find`/`all` matchers) or methods whose name implies
that they work with either CSS or XPath selector
(`has_selector?`/`has_css?`/`has_xpath?` matchers) use selectors as locators.

all other methods designed to work with specific elements
(`click_link`, `has_field?`, `find_button`, etc.)
use attribute values and texts to find corresponding elements only -
they don't accept CSS or XPath selectors!

### selectors

CSS is default selector.

XPath selector can be specified inline:

```ruby
find(:xpath, '//ul/li').text
```

or set as default selector:

```ruby
Capybara.default_selector = :xpath
find('//ul/li').text
```

#### custom selectors

definition:

```ruby
Capybara.add_selector(:row) do
  xpath { |num| ".//tbody/tr[#{num}]" }
end

Capybara.add_selector(:flash_type) do
  css { |type| "#flash.#{type}" }
end
```

usage:

```ruby
find(:row, 3)
find(:flash_type, :notice)
```

### navigation

- `visit`:

  ```ruby
  visit('/projects')
  visit(post_comments_path(post))
  ```

### actions (clicking)

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions>

- `click_button`
- `click_link`
- `click_link_or_button` (also: `click_on`)

### actions (interacting with forms)

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions>

common actions:

- `fill_in` (fill text input or textarea)
- `choose` (mark radio button as checked)
- `check` / `uncheck` (mark checkbox as checked or unchecked)
- `select` (select particular option from select box)
- `attach_file` (attach file given its path)

### matchers (querying)

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Matchers>

matchers check if page or current node have specified elements or text.

generic Capybara matchers:

- `has_selector?` (`has_xpath?`/`has_css?`)
- `has_text?` (also: `has_content?`)

specific matchers (not all):

- `has_field?`
- `has_link?`
- `has_button?`

all Capybara matchers have corresponding Capybara RSpec matchers:

- `has_selector?` -> `have_selector`
- `has_text?` -> `have_text`

### finders

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Finders>

finders like actions or matchers use selectors to find elements.

generic finders:

- `find` to find one element
- `all` to find all elements

specific finders (not all):

- `find_field`
- `find_link`
- `find_button`
- `find_by_id`

### scoping

generic method is `within` - it uses selector to restrict actions
within a specific area of the page or node.

specific scoping methods:

- `within_fieldset`
- `within_table`

### scripting

**NOTE**: only if driver supports executing JS.

- `execute_script` (doesn't returt the result - for complicated scripts)
- `evaluate_script` (return the result of the script - for simple scripts)

```ruby
page.execute_script("$('body').empty()")
result = page.evaluate_script('4 + 4')
```

### modals

**NOTE**: only if supported by driver.

wrap code that produces modal in a block:

- `accept_alert` / `dismiss_alert`
- `accept_confirm` / `dismiss_confirm`
- `accept_prompt` / `dismiss_prompt`

example:

```ruby
accept_alert do
  click_link('Show Alert')
end
```

### debugging

- `save_and_open_page` - open page in browser as it currently is
- `print page.html` - get current state of DOM as a string

if supported by driver and `capybara-screenshot` gem is installed:

- `page.save_screenshot('screenshot.png')`
- `save_and_open_screenshot`

## matching

how Capybara finds elements is customized using 2 options:

- `Capybara.exact`
- `Capybara.match`

### exactness (`Capybara.exact`)

- if `true` partial matches are not allowed
- false by default

can be set:

- in _rspec_helper.rb_:

  ```ruby
  Capybara.exact = true
  ```

- inline for particular test (overrides global value):

  ```ruby
  click_link("Password", exact: false)
  ```

### strategy  (`Capybara.match`)

- controls how Capybara behaves when multiple elements match a query

4 strategies:

- `first` - pick the 1st element that matches (either exact or partial match)
- `one` - raise error if >1 element matches (default for Capybara 2.0.x)
- `smart` (default for current Capybara - 2.7.0):
  - `exact` is `true` (the same as `one`):
    1. try to find exact match - raise error if >1 element matches
  - `exact` is `false`:
    1. try to find exact match - raise error if >1 element matches
    2. try to find partial match - raise error if >1 element matches
- `prefer_exact` - pick the 1st exactly matching element (default for Capybara 1.x)

## transactions

- <https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/transactions>

for some drivers (Selenium) Capybara starts an actual HTTP server in
the same process but in a separate thread.
RackTest is not one of these drivers - it uses Rack interface to interact
with your application.

this might pose a problem when accessing DB since transactions are not
shared among threads - Capybara will not see changes made to DB.

**solution**

- turn off running each test (example) within a transaction by RSpec
  (`use_transactional_fixtures` option must be `false`)
- use database truncation instead of wrapping specs in transactions
  for all drivers but RackTest
  (configure this with `database_cleaner` gem)

_spec/rails_helper.rb_
(DatabaseCleaner configuration section is from DatabaseCleaner's
[README](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner#rspec-with-capybara-example)):

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # true by default
  config.use_transactional_fixtures = false
end

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DatabaseCleaner
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:suite) do
    if config.use_transactional_fixtures?
      raise(<<-MSG)
        Don't let RSpec run examples in transactions -
        let DatabaseCleaner decide whether to do it or not.
      MSG
    end

    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with :truncation
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
  end

  config.before(:each, type: :feature) do
    if Capybara.current_driver != :rack_test
      DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
    end
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.start
  end

  config.append_after(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end
end
```

## Ajax

Capybara waits for elements to appear on page - it retries finding the element
for a brief period of time (2 seconds by default) before giving up and throwing
error. this period can be adjusted:

```ruby
Capybara.default_max_wait_time = 5
```

Capybara retries finding the element for 2 seconds only if it's not found.
if it's necessary to check that the element is not present after Ajax request
use `has_no_XXX?` matchers instead since they wait for the asynchronous process
to complete while `has_XXX?` matchers check presence of the element immediately
and falsely return true:

```ruby
!page.has_xpath?('a')   # finds <a> element (but shouldn't)
page.has_no_xpath?('a') # doesn't find <a> element (okay)
```

this doesn't concern Capybara RSpec matchers - these statements are equivalent:

```ruby
expect(page).not_to have_xpath('a')
expect(page).to have_no_xpath('a')
```

both of them wait for the asynchronous process to complete before checking
the element for the presence.

## calling remote servers

RackTest driver doesn't support calling remote servers -
in-process Rack applications only.

to work with remote server:

```ruby
Capybara.current_driver = :selenium
Capybara.app_host = 'http://www.google.com'
...
visit('/')
```

or else visit URL directly:

```ruby
visit('http://www.google.com')
```

if working with remote server it's not necessary to boot rack application -
you can configure Capybara not to do it automatically:

```ruby
Capybara.run_server = false
```

## structure of feature specs

- **feature** - some UI step that is tested (sign in, sign out, payment, etc.)
- **scenario** - user path (success, failure, robokassa payment, bank payment, etc.)

steps to implement feature spec:

- visit page
- do user action (click UI element, fill in the form and submit it, etc.)
- check the result:
  - current path (using `current_path` helper)
  - presence or absence of UI elements (using matchers) -
    either on the whole page (`page`) or
    inside container UI elements found with finders
  - database state (if relevant)

don't test internal application logic that doesn't depend on user actions -
e.g. redirects that depend on system state managed by application itself.

if something is easier to test with unit tests then it shouldn't be tested
with feature specs.

## troubleshooting

### domain is set to `example.com` in tests

- <http://stackoverflow.com/a/23235547>
- <http://stefan.magnuson.co/articles/rails/robust-integration-testing-in-rails-4-with-rspec-capybara-and-selenium/>

all in all don't test against domain - use `_path` helpers only.

### `login_as` method doesn't log in user

still not resolved.

### assets (both CSS and JS) are not served when using any JS driver

in my case the problem was that both CSS and JS application manifests were not
linked using asset tag helpers (`stylesheet_link_tag` and `javascript_include_tag`)
in application layout file (_application.html.slim_) for test Rails environment:

```ruby
- unless Rails.env.test?
  = stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true
  = javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true
```

also rendering jivosite partial resulted in JS error about `$` being undefined:

```ruby
= render 'application/jivosite'
```

but this is not critical and doesn't influence loading application manifests.

### debugging commands hang when using `binding.pry` with `webkit` driver

use `selenium` driver or first insert debugging commands before `binding.pry`
and only then run your specs (hang occurs only when issuing debugging commands
after code execution has been paused by `binding.pry`).

### `selenium` driver sometimes fails to locate elements

when using `selenium` driver Capybara sometimes fails to locate elements
(links in my case) on page.
increasing `Capybara.default_max_wait_time` doesn't help.

for some reason it doesn't happen when using `webkit` driver.

### most likely `find_field` doesn't work with submit inputs

just find submit inputs with `find`: `find("input[type='submit']")`.

### persisted data is not available in tests

sure there might be different reasons for this including wrapping tests
in transactions (see [transactions](#transactios)) but it my case the problem
was as following:

- click link that submits form to payments controller
- get payment persisted in payments controller action

but the payment is `nil`.

the point is that when reading database in spec you don't wait till controller
action is completed and page fully rendered - unlike Capybara matchers or finders.

that is why it's necessary to wait till new page is ready and the simplest way
to do it is to use some Capybara matcher (e.g. checking `current_page` before
reading database).
