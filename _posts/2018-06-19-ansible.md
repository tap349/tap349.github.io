installation
------------

```sh
$ brew install ansible
```

add SSH config entry for remote node:

```sshconfig
# .ssh/config

Host sithex
 User root
 Hostname DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 ForwardAgent yes
```

install Python on remote node:

```sh
$ ssh sithex
# apt install python
```

configuration
-------------

create inventory file:

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-03>
>
> Hosts in inventory can be grouped arbitrarily. For instance, you could
> have a debian group, a web-servers group, a production group, etc...

```yaml
[web]
sithex
```

`[web]` here is a group name (optional).

now ping all nodes:

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-02>
>
> `all` is a shortcut meaning 'all hosts found in inventory file'.

```
$ ansible all -m ping
sithex | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

execute shell command on specific node:

```
$ ansible sithex -m shell -a 'date'
sithex | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
Mon Jun 18 22:58:35 UTC 2018
```

notes
-----

### roles

roles are executed once within one play only (where hosts are specified) -
not across all plays and playbooks in Ansible project:

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html>
>
> Role dependencies are always executed before the role that includes them, and
> may be recursive. Dependencies also follow the duplication rules specified above.

### pre_tasks

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/reference_appendices/playbooks_keywords.html#play>
>
> pre_tasks
>   A list of tasks to execute before roles.

> <https://github.com/Mohitsharma44/ansible-playbooks/wiki/vars-pre-post-and-handlers#pre_tasks-and-post_tasks>
>
> A general use case for pre_task could be when you need to make sure that your
> system package manager's cache is updated.

tips
----

### common roles directory for Ansible projects

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-search-path>
>
> In Ansible 1.4 and later you can configure an additional roles_path to
> search for roles. Use this to check all of your common roles out to one
> location, and share them easily between multiple playbook projects.

environments
------------

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#alternative-directory-layout>
2. <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-multistage-environments-with-ansible#using-ansible-constructs-that-allow-explicit-loading-order>

```yaml
# inventories/prod/group_vars/all

env: prod
```

```yaml
# inventories/stage/group_vars/all

env: stage
```

now `env` variable is available in all plays and roles.
