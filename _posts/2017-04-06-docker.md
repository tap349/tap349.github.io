first steps with Docker and troubleshooting.

<!-- more -->

## getting started

docker handles containers, docker-compose handles services.

### docker-compose

- <http://stackoverflow.com/a/35585573/3632318>

_.docker-compose.yml_ file lists services along with their images,
commands and volumes (= mounted directories).
service is used to run command within specified image,
service is run by 1+ containers.

for `docker-compose` commands to work _.docker-compose.yml_ file must
be present in current or one of parent directories.

- `docker-compose up -d`

  create and start containers for all services
  (pull required Docker images from Docker hub as part of the process).

  use `-d` option to do it in detached mode (in background).

- `docker-compose start/stop/restart app`

  start/stop/restart services.

- `docker-compose ps`

  list containers (name, command, state, ports):

  ```
         Name                      Command               State           Ports
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  server_app_1          rackup -o 0.0.0.0 -p 4321        Up      0.0.0.0:4321->4321/tcp
  server_db_1           docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      5432/tcp
  ```

  use `-a` option to show all containers (only running containers are shown by default):

  `docker ps -a`

- `docker-compose logs app`

  view output from all containers and from containers of specified service.

  `app` above is a service name.

  use `-f` option to follow log output (= `tail -f`):

  `docker-compose logs -f app`

  use `-t` option to show timestamps:

  `docker-compose logs -t app`

### docker

- `docker images`

  list images.

- `docker ps`

  list containers (container_id, image, command, created, status, ports, names):

  ```
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  PORTS                    NAMES
  732******500   v***n/n**   "rackup -o 0.0.0.0..."   0.0.0.0:4321->4321/tcp   server_app_1
  e0e******c7c   postgres    "docker-entrypoint..."   5432/tcp                 server_db_1
  ```

  note that `CREATED` and `STATUS` columns have been removed from output for
  the sake of readability.

- `docker logs server_app_1`

  same as `docker-compose logs app` but for container instead of service.

- `docker build -t v***n/n** ./`

  build image from Dockerfile (the latter must be present in CWD).
  it's necessary to rebuild the whole image when you make any changes that
  must be persisted (for `app` service: when you modify ruby source code).

- `docker run -ti v***n/n** sh`

  NOTE: any changes made within image (like installing packages, etc.)
        are lost when container exits (except changes in mounted volume)!

  run command in a new container - image name must be specified.

  if command (like `sh`) is not specified default command is run
  (argument passed to `CMD` in base image Dockerfile).

  use `-t` option to allocate pseudo-TTY (without it prompt is not displayed).

  use `-i` option to make session interactive
  (without it session exits after the first user input inside container).

  use `-v` bind to mount volume inside container:

  `docker run -ti -v <local_dir>:<remote_dir> v***n/n** sh`

- `docker exec -ti 732******500 sh`

  run command in a running container - container id from `docker ps` output
  must be specified (unlike image name for `docker run`).

  use `-i` and `-t` options in the same way as for `docker run`.

## troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?

just install Docker app via `brew cask`.
it's possible to install all the necessary docker tools (`boot2docker`,
`docker`, `docker-compose`, etc.) manually but I didn't manage to configure
them all in reasonable time. so it's better to install Docker app - it does
all the heavy lifting for you.

`$ brew cask install docker`

don't forget to run Docker app after installation
(otherwise `docker` command might be not available in terminal).

### lookup registry-1.docker.io on 192.168.65.1:53: no such host

when running `docker run hello-world` command host to pull `hello-world`
image from is not found.

host lookup fails when using some DNS servers (in particular when using
DNS server of my Internet provider) - use Google DNS server 8.8.8.8 instead.
