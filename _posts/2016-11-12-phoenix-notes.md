notes about phoenix (maybe this article will be split into several parts later).

<!-- more -->

- `iex` - doesn't load your app (equivalent of `irb`)
- `iex -S mix` - loads your app (equivalent of `rails console`)
- `iex -S mix phoenix.server` - loads your app and launches web server
  (`rails console` inside `rails server` - or vice versa)
