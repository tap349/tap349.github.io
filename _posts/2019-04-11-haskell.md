Types

> The Haskell standard data type Maybe is typically declared as:
>
> data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
>
> What this means is that the type Maybe has one type variable,
> represented by the a and two constructors Just and Nothing.

### Maybe

2. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/18809252/3632318>

> instances of Functor and Monad are defined for Maybe.
>
> For Functor, the fmap function moves inside the Just constructor and is
> identity on the Nothing constructor.
>
> For Monad, the bind operation passes through Just, while Nothing will
> force the result to always be Nothing.
