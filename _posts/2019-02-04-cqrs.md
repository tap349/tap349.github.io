- CQS acts at component (micro) level - it's about having different functions
  for reading and writing
- CQRS acts at context (macro) level - it's about having different paths to
  process request

=> CQRS is not just about mechanical splitting read and write functions - it's
a comprehensive approach to processing requests which can include many aspects
(say, read and write operations might even use different stores).

### CQRS vs. ES

in CQRS you don't have to use ES but this combination is quite popular so more
often than not when people speak about CQRS they mean using ES as well.
