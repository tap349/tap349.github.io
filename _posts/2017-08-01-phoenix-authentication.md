that is you need external storage to revoke JWT token before it expires -
say, `Guardian DB` package allows to track tokens in database when using
`Guardian`.

<https://github.com/ueberauth/guardian_db#disadvantages>:

> With Guardian.DB, every request requires a trip to the database,

when using JWT token for browser sessions, just flush the session.
