### interactive history of commands

`q:`

- opens command-editing window with history of commands
- commands can be edited in-place and run with <C-CR>
- can also be opened with <C-f> when typing ex command
  (can be useful to type/edit complex commands)

### current mapping of any key or key combination

`:verbose map <S-CR>`
`:verbose nmap ,f`

### global command

`:g`

<http://disq.us/p/dkhy28>:

> The global command is actually the origin of grep's name - :g/re/p would
> print out all lines matching the regular expression "re".

### make all windows within tab equally high and wide

`<C-w>=`
`:help window-resize`
