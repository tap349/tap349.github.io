## layouts in Rails

<http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#finding-layouts>

looking up current layout in Rails (more specific match wins):

- application layout (_app/views/layouts/application.html.slim_)
- controller-specific layout (_app/views/layouts/photos.html.slim_)
- `layout 'header'` declaration in controller
  (can be overriden by child controllers)
- `render layout: 'header'`:
  - in controller action to render action view
    (overrides controller's layout)
  - in view itself with view content passed in block argument
    (renders view in specified layout keeping controller's layout)

## SASS mixins

<http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6>

## width vs max-width

<http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_max-width.asp>

- `max-width` \> `width` => `width`
- `max-width` \< `width` => `max-width`

## media queries

- <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp>
- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8549529/what-is-the-difference-between-screen-and-only-screen-in-media-queries>

in CSS2 they were called media types, in CSS3 - media queries.

media queries can be used to check:

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- orientation (landscape or portrait)
- resolution

syntax:

```
@media not|only media_type and (media_feature) {
    CSS-Code;
}
```

- specifying media type can be omitted (`all` media type is used by default)
- `only` keyword is used to hide related CSS from older user agents
  (they consider it to be unknown media type and just ignore related CSS) -
  new user agents ignore `only` keyword

media types:

- `all` (default)
- `screen` (screets, smartphones, tablets - most common)
- `print` (printers)
- `speech` (screenreaders)

other media types are deprecated.

media features:

- `max-height`/`max-width` (max height or width of display area - browser window)
- `min-height`/`min-width` (min height or width of display area - browser window)
- `max-device-height`/`max-device-width` (max height or width of device - computer screen)
- `min-device-height`/`min-device-width` (min height or width of device - computer screen)

## using images

- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16843143/rails-4-image-path-image-url-and-asset-url-no-longer-work-in-scss-files>
- <http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#asset-tag-helpers>

## positioning

`position: absolute`:

- `right` sets offset to the left of right border of parent container
- `margin-right` sets a new offset relative to the offset set by `right`

## mobile-first design

<http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/>

- easier to extend for larger screens than vice versa
- serving styles without media queries is faster
  (important for mobile devices)
- serving mobile styles first supports more devices
  (some devices might not support media queries at all)

the article contains many tips on how to design for mobile.

## responsive vs adaptive design

<https://studio.uxpin.com/blog/responsive-vs-adaptive-design-whats-best-choice-designers/>

- responsive design: `@media (min-width: X)`
- adaptive design: `@media (min-device-width: X)`

## removing border

<http://stackoverflow.com/a/2922934/3632318>

- `border: 0` (short for `border-width: 0`)
- `border: none` (short for `border-style: none`)
