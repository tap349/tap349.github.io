notes
-----

```sh
$ brew install ansible
```

add SSH config entry for remote node:

```sshconfig
# .ssh/config

Host sithex
 User root
 Hostname DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 ForwardAgent yes
```

install Python on remote node:

```sh
$ ssh sithex
# apt install python
```

create inventory file:

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-03>
>
> Hosts in inventory can be grouped arbitrarily. For instance, you could
> have a debian group, a web-servers group, a production group, etc...

```yaml
[web]
sithex
```

`[web]` here is a group name (optional).

now ping all nodes:

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-02>
>
> `all` is a shortcut meaning 'all hosts found in inventory file'.

```
$ ansible all -m ping
sithex | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

execute shell command on specific node:

```
$ ansible sithex -m shell -a 'date'
sithex | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>

### common roles directory for playbook projects

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-search-path>
>
> In Ansible 1.4 and later you can configure an additional roles_path to
> search for roles. Use this to check all of your common roles out to one
> location, and share them easily between multiple playbook projects.
