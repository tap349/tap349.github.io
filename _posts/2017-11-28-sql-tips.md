(how to) specify condition in COUNT
-----------------------------------

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN is_admin IS TRUE THEN 1 END) AS admin_count FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN is_admin IS TRUE THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS admin_count FROM users;
```

NOTE: don't specify `ELSE 0` in condition - all rows will be counted then!

[PostgreSQL] (how to) count occurrences of specific element in array column
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/26524451/3632318>

count occurrences of player id 2503 in all rows (in all games):

```sql
=# select * from game_stats;

 id | game_id |     player_ids    |
----+---------+-------------------+
  1 |   17233 |  {}               |
  2 |   17235 |  {}               |
  3 |   17210 |  {2503}           |
  4 |   17213 |  {2502,2503,2503} |
```

```sql
SELECT
  unnested_game_stats.game_id AS game_id,
  COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM (
  SELECT
    game_stats.game_id AS game_id,
    UNNEST(game_stats.player_ids) AS player_id
  FROM game_stats
) unnested_game_stats
WHERE unnested_game_stats.player_id = 2503
```

[PostgreSQL] (how to) expand multiple array columns to a set of rows
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-array.html>
2. <http://www.sql.ru/forum/1112093/funkciya-unnest>

4. <https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/52124690.8050309%40cybertec.at>

calculate total penalty time for player id 2503 in all rows (in all games):

```sql
=# select * from game_stats;

 id  | game_id | penalized_player_ids | penalty_times
-----+---------+----------------------+---------------
 908 |   40885 | {2503, 2503}         | {6,8}
 907 |   40882 | {2502, 2503}         | {2,4}
```

[this](<https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/52124690.8050309%40cybertec.at>)
email from `pgsql-hackers` mailing list contains the only (!) example of using
`UNNEST` function with table columns instead of arrays I've managed to find on
the Internet.

to expand multiple array columns to a set of rows so that the 1st row contains
the 1st elements of all array columns, the 2nd row contains the 2nd elements of
all array columns, etc. you've got to:

- select table first
- pass its array column names to `UNNEST` function
- alias new columns if you want to use them in `SELECT` clause

```sql
SELECT
  unnested_game_stats.game_id AS game_id,
  COALESCE(CAST(SUM(unnested_game_stats.penalty_time) AS INTEGER), 0)
    AS penalty_time_game_sum
FROM (
  SELECT
    game_stats.game_id AS game_id,
    penalties.penalized_player_id AS penalized_player_id,
    penalties.penalty_time AS penalty_time
  FROM game_stats, UNNEST(
    game_stats.penalized_player_ids,
    game_stats.penalty_times
  ) AS penalties(penalized_player_id, penalty_time)
) unnested_game_stats
WHERE unnested_game_stats.penalized_player_id = 2503
```

here we select from table and a set of rows returned by `UNNEST` function
(that is passed this table array column names) - but the result is not a
Cartesian product (cross join) of all sources: each table row is properly
joined with its own unnested values of array columns.

should you replace array column names with arrays, you'll get a typical
cross join:

```sql
SELECT game_stats.id, first, second
FROM game_stats, UNNEST(array[1, 2], array[3, 4]) AS t(first, second)
```

you can get the same result by adding 2 array columns to the table and
updating ALL records with `{1,2}` and `{3,4}` values in these columns.

[PostgreSQL] (how to) to find first/last rows within a group
------------------------------------------------------------

for example, this is how to find creation date of the youngest post
for each user:

- using `GROUP BY user_id` + `MIN(created_at)`

  1. <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/ordering-within-a-sql-group-by-clause>

  ```sql
  SELECT users.*, p.created_at
  FROM users
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT user_id, MIN(created_at) AS created_at
    FROM posts
    GROUP BY user_id
  ) AS p ON p.user_id = users.id
  ```

  use `MAX(created_at)` to find creation date of the oldest post.

- using `ORDER BY user_id, created_at ASC` + `DISTINCT ON (user_id)`

  1. <https://zaiste.net/postgresql_distinct_on>
  2. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15206809/activerecord-select-first-record-from-each-group>

  ```sql
  SELECT users.*, p.created_at
  FROM users
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (user_id) user_id, created_at
    FROM posts
    ORDER BY user_id, created_at ASC
  ) AS p ON p.user_id = users.id
  ```

  order by `created_at DESC` to find creation date of the oldest post.

  advantage of `DISTINCT_ON` is that it's possible to select any columns
  in the first row of the group while with `GROUP BY` you are limited
  to aggregates and the column which appears in `GROUP BY` clause only -
  say, we need to select title of the youngest post as well:

  ```sql
  SELECT users.*, p.title, p.created_at
  FROM users
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (user_id) user_id, title, created_at
    FROM posts
    ORDER BY user_id, created_at ASC
  ) AS p ON p.user_id = users.id
  ```

- using `OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at ASC)` + `ROW_NUMBER()`

  1. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/tutorial-window.html>
  2. <http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-window-function>
  3. <https://zaiste.net/postgresql_distinct_on>

  ```sql
  SELECT users.*, p.name, p.created_at
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT user_id, created_at, ROW_NUMBER() AS rn
    OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at ASC)
    FROM posts
  ) AS p ON p.user_id = users.id AND p.rn = 1
  ```

  using `ROW_NUMBER()` window function it's possible to find not only
  the first or the last row but any row in between too (say, creation
  date of the post that was created second).

  just like with `DISTINCT_ON` it's possible to select any columns in
  requested row.

  `ROW_NUMBER()` vs. `RANK()`:
