## layouts in Rails

<http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#finding-layouts>

looking up current layout in Rails (more specific match wins):

- application layout (_app/views/layouts/application.html.slim_)
- controller-specific layout (_app/views/layouts/photos.html.slim_)
- `layout 'header'` declaration in controller
  (can be overriden by child controllers)
- `render layout: 'header'`:
  - in controller action to render action view
    (overrides controller's layout)
  - in view itself with view content passed in block argument
    (renders view in specified layout keeping controller's layout)

## application layout classes

consider adding 2 classes to `<body>` of each page in `application.html.slim`:

1. `"c-#{controller_name}"`
2. `"p-#{controller_name}-#{action_name}"`

it will make it easier to bind common CSS rules for all actions of controller:

```sass
.c-sites
  padding: 10px
  ...
```

instead of:

```sass
.sites-index,
.sites-new,
.sites-show
  padding: 10px
  ...
```

also it will make it natural to have this file naming scheme:

- _app/assets/sites.sass_ for controller-wide CSS rules
- _app/assets/sites/show.sass_ for page-specific CSS rules

## SASS mixins

<http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6>

## width vs max-width

<http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_max-width.asp>

- `max-width` \> `width` => `width`
- `max-width` \< `width` => `max-width`

## media queries

- <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp>
- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8549529>

in CSS2 they were called media types, in CSS3 - media queries.

media queries are used to define different style rules for
different media types after checking media features:

- width and height of the viewport (display area, browser window)
- width and height of the device (computer screen)
- orientation (landscape or portrait)
- resolution

for styles rules (CSS) to be applied media queries must resolve to true
(media type matches device **and** all media features are true).

media query syntax (using SASS):

```
@media not|only media_type and (media_feature)
  CSS
```

- specifying media type can be omitted (`all` media type is used by default)
- `only` keyword is used to hide associated CSS from older user agents
  (they consider it to be unknown media type and just ignore associated CSS) -
  new user agents ignore `only` keyword

media types (devices):

- `all` (default)
- `screen` (screens, smartphones, tablets - most common)
- `print` (printers)
- `speech` (screenreaders)

other media types are deprecated.

media features:

- `max-height`/`max-width` (max height or width of viewport)
- `min-height`/`min-width` (min height or width of viewport)
- `max-device-height`/`max-device-width` (max height or width of device)
- `min-device-height`/`min-device-width` (min height or width of device)

## using images

<http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#asset-tag-helpers>

Rails asset tag helpers:

- `javascript_include_tag` (commonly used in `<head>` section)
- `stylesheet_link_tag` (commonly used in `<head>` section)
- `image_tag`
- `video_tag`
- `audio_tag`

asset tag helpers don't check presence of assets at specified locations.

<http://stackoverflow.com/a/20211017>

images are placed in _app/assets/images/_ and can be used in:

- view (`image_tag` helper)
- CSS:
  - `background: image-url('logo.png')`
    (Rails path helper - image is loaded in separate request)
  - `background: inline-image('logo.png')`
    (Compass inline data helper - embeds image directly in CSS)

## positioning

`position: absolute`:

- `right` sets offset to the left of right border of parent container
- `margin-right` sets a new offset relative to the offset set by `right`

## mobile-first design

<http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/>

**NOTE**: the article contains many tips on how to design for mobile.

advantages of mobile-first design:

- easier to extend for larger screens than vice versa
- serving styles without media queries is faster
  (important for mobile devices)
- serving mobile styles first supports more devices
  (some devices might not support media queries at all)

ALWAYS CHECK mobile design on mobile phone itself
(or at least using device mode of Developer Tools in Chrome)!

## responsive vs adaptive design

<https://studio.uxpin.com/blog/responsive-vs-adaptive-design-whats-best-choice-designers/>

- responsive design: `@media (min-width: X)`
- adaptive design: `@media (min-device-width: X)`

## my implementation of mobile-first responsive design

**NOTE**: container div is parent of both sidebar and main divs.

- mobile version (primary):
  - stack sidebar and main divs on top of each other
    (using default `display: block`)
- desktop version (activated by media query):
  - make sidebar div float to the right
    (alternatively use `display: inline-block` for sidebar and main divs)
  - set container `max-width` property
  - fix all paddings and margins

## removing border

<http://stackoverflow.com/a/2922934/3632318>

- `border: 0` (short for `border-width: 0`)
- `border: none` (short for `border-style: none`)

## `z-index`

`z-index` property is used to specify z-order (the stack order) of elements:

- by default `z-index: auto` (element has the same stack level as its parent)
- element with higher z-index is in front of element with lower z-index
- works on positioned elements only (with position `absolute`, `relative` or `fixed`)

avoid using sequential numbers that don't count from 1 (e.g. `5,6,7..`)
as it might lead to confusion about where missing z-indexes (`1,2,3,4`) are.

prefer sequences `1,2,3...` (without gaps) or `100,200,300...`.

## cursors

- always use `cursor: pointer` for clickable elements
- by default `cursor: auto` is used - browser sets a cursor

when using default cursor I couldn't click search icon at the bottom (1-2 px) -
probably the very tip of default cursor is not active (can't be used for pointing).
