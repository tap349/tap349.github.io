### notes

<https://github.com/rails/webpacker>:

NODE_ENV values:

- production
- development

assets are compiled in NODE_ENV mode but use/load RAILS_ENV configuration
(production environment is used as a fallback one) from _config/webpacker.yml_.

> binstubs compile in development mode, rake tasks compile in production mode:

```ruby
# compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified
./bin/webpack
./bin/webpack-dev-server

# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified
bundle exec rails assets:precompile
bundle exec rails webpacker:compile
```
