```sh
$ brew install ansible
```

add SSH config entry for remote node:

```sshconfig
# .ssh/config

Host sithex
 User root
 Hostname DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 ForwardAgent yes
```

install Python on remote node:

```sh
$ ssh sithex
# apt install python
```

create inventory file:

> Hosts in inventory can be grouped arbitrarily. For instance, you could
> have a debian group, a web-servers group, a production group, etc...

```yaml
[ubuntu]
sithex
```

`[ubuntu]` here is a group name (optional).

now ping all nodes:

> `all` is a shortcut meaning 'all hosts found in inventory file'.

```
$ ansible all -m ping
sithex | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

execute shell command on specific node:

```
$ ansible sithex -m shell -a 'date'
sithex | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
