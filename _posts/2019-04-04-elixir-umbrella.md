tips

### don't configure umbrella application

you cannot add any options to `umbrella_app` configuration:

```elixir
# umbrella_app/config/config.exs

config :umbrella_app, foo: 123
```

you'll this warning during compilation as a result:

```
You have configured application :umbrella_app in your configuration file,
but the application is not available.

This usually means one of:

  1. You have not added the application as a dependency in a mix.exs file.

  2. You are configuring an application that does not really exist.

Please ensure :alice exists or remove the configuration.
```

I guess this is because umbrella application is just a container of other
applications but not a proper application itself - it has no `app` key in
its project configuration as well (`project/0` function inside _mix.exs_).
