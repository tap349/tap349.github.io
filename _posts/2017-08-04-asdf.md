don't install via brew since brew formula places asdf files into
_/usr/local/opt/asdf/_ - this operation requires sudo privileges.

also after installing Elixir plugin and setting current version
`elixir` executable just wasn't found - that is asdf didn't work at all.

<https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf>:

```sh
$ brew uninstall --force elixir
$ rm -rf ~/.mix/
$ git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.3.0
$ asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir
$ asdf install elixir 1.5.1
$ asdf global elixir 1.5.1
$ asdf current elixir
$ elixir -v
$ cd <project>
$ mix compile
```
