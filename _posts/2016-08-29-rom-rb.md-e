commands
--------

### delete

_lib/persistence/repositories/users.rb_:

```ruby
module Persistence::Repositories
  class Users < Base[:users]
    commands :create, update: :by_pk, delete: :by_pk
    relations :google_adwords_configs

    ...
  end
end
```

all custom delete methods below are defined inside repository.
probably this is a wrong way - create a separate command for each case
with a single entry point (`#execute(tuple)`).
see <https://github.com/icelab/berg/tree/master/lib/persistence/commands>
for examples.

#### delete by id

use generated delete method in repository:

```ruby
users_repo.delete(user_id)
```

#### delete all

call delete on relation:

```ruby
module Persistence::Repositories
  class Users < Base[:users]
    def delete_all
      users.delete
    end
  end
end
```

#### delete with condition

get required relation view before calling delete:

```ruby
module Persistence::Repositories
  class Users < Base[:users]
    def delete_by_email email
      users.by_email(email).delete
    end
  end
end
```
