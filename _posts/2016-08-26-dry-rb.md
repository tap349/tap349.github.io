## testing

- example usage: <https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/pull/11#issuecomment-184765175>
- source: <https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-container/blob/master/lib/dry/container/stub.rb>

### setup

NOTE: this setup is required only when using container stubs.

_config/environment.rb_:

```ruby
# Load and finalize DI container
require_relative '../system/my_app/container'

# Enable container stubs in test environment only
if Rails.env.test?
  require 'dry/container/stub'
  MyApp::Container.enable_stubs!
end

# Don't finalize container in test environment at all since
# it freezes container class and you cannot:
# - enable stubs at all if you do it after container finalization
#   (since it extends container class with `Dry::Container::Stub`)
# - stub anything in your specs
MyApp::Container.finalize! unless Rails.env.test?
```

TODO: in RB container is finalized unconditionally and container stubs
      still work even though container class is frozen - why?

### usage

- <https://discuss.dry-rb.org/t/example-changes-of-dependencies/50>

#### controller specs

the problem in controller specs is that you cannot stub specific
container entry in before block because by this time controller object
will have already been instantiated and injected with real objects.
thus the only way to stub injected dependency in controller specs is
to stub corresponding method in created PORO (see #2 below).

#### PORO specs

- stub component in container

```ruby
describe Item::Create do
  let(:operation) { described_class.new }

  let(:process_item) { double call: nil }
  before { MyApp::Container.stub('svcs.process_item', process_item) }
  before { operation.call }

  it { expect(process_item).to have_received(:call) }
end
```

- stub method in PORO

```ruby
describe Item::Create do
  let(:operation) { described_class.new }

  let(:process_item) { double call: nil }
  before { allow(operation).to receive(:process_item).and_return process_item }
  before { operation.call }

  it { expect(process_item).to have_received(:call) }
end
```

- pass double to PORO constructor (emulate injecting dependency)

`kwargs` injection strategy is the default so pass a hash
([source](https://discuss.dry-rb.org/t/example-changes-of-dependencies/50/3)):

```ruby
describe Item::Create do
  let(:operation) { described_class.new process_item: process_item }

  let(:process_item) { double call: nil }
  before { operation.call }

  it { expect(process_item).to have_received(:call) }
end
```
