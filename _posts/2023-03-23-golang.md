## Locations

See values of all Golang environment variables with `go env`

- installation of Go itself - `$GOROOT`
  (say, _$HOME/.asdf/installs/golang/1.20.2/go_)
- downloaded packages (module cache + binaries) - `$GOPATH`
  (say, _$HOME/.asdf/installs/golang/1.20.2/packages_)
- module cache - `$GOMODCACHE`
  (say, _$HOME/.asdf/installs/golang/1.20.2/packages/pkg/mod_)
- binaries - `$GOPATH/bin`
  (say, _$HOME/.asdf/installs/golang/1.20.2/packages/bin_)

So `go install` installs a package into 2 directories:

- `$GOMODCACHE` (package source code)
- `$GOPATH/bin` (package binaries if any)

## Golang and asdf

After installing a new package with `go install` it's necessary to reshim
`golang` plugin to create shims for new binaries and make them available in
`PATH`:

```sh
$ asdf reshim golang
```

## `go get` vs. `go install`

1. <https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1608961684-About-go-get-and-go-install-in-Go-1-16>
2. `go help get`
3. `go help install`

Since Go 1.16:

`go get`

- downloads specified package with dependencies into module cache
- updates _go.mod_ (adds packages as dependencies to current module)

`go install`:

- downloads specified package with dependencies into module cache
- builds downloaded packages
- installs binaries into `$GOPATH/bin`
