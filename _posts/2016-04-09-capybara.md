## about

key benefits:

- no setup (works out of the box for Rails and Rack applications)
- intuitive API (mimics user language)
- switch backends without changes to tests
- no need to manually wait for async process to complete

Capybara:

- is just an API that provides a layer of abstraction on top of
  actual automation library (driver) - like Selenium WebDriver
- is written in ruby
- supports testing web applications written in many languages and frameworks
  (though originally was created for testing Rails applications)
- provides DSL for test automation
- allows to write tests once and run them in any compatible driver
- has built-in drivers - additional drivers are available as gems
- handles asynchronous JS without the user even noticing

## installation

_Gemfile_:

```ruby
gem 'capybara'
```

_rails_helper.rb_ (not required indeed):

```ruby
require 'capybara/rails'
```

## RSpec integration

_rails_helper.rb_ (not required indeed):

```ruby
require 'capybara/rspec'
```

RSpec can be configured to infer spec type from a file location (Rails only):

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
end
```

in this case all specs in _spec/features/_ have type `feature` automatically
(Capybara specs).

or else just tag example groups with `type: :feature` manually
if file location is different.

## drivers

### using JS driver

use `js: true` option to switch to JS driver (`selenium` by default).

### switching drivers

- set default driver globally in _rails_helper.rb_:

  ```ruby
  Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
  # default JS driver - when `js: true` is used
  Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
  ```

- set current driver temporarily in before/after blocks:

  ```ruby
  Capybara.current_driver = :webkit # before block
  Capybara.use_default_driver       # after block
  ```

- set driver for specific test using `driver` option:

  ```ruby
  describe 'some stuff which requires js', js: true do
    it 'will use the default js driver'
    it 'will switch to one specific driver', driver: :webkit
  end
  ```

switching driver creates a new session -
you may not be able to switch in the middle of a test.

### driver types

headless drivers don't require display server (X11, Xvfb, etc.) -
all drivers mentioned below except Selenium are headless.

#### RackTest

- default driver (`rack_test`) - fast but limited
- doesn't support executing JS
- headless driver
- directly interacts with Rack interfaces -
  doesn't require a server to be started
- can be used with Rack applications only
- cannot access HTTP resources outside of Rack app
  (e.g., redirects to external sites, external APIs)

for RSpec it's better to have `rack_test` as default driver and
mark tests that require JS support with `js: true` to use default JS driver.

#### Selenium

- `selenium-webdriver` gem
- supports executing JS
- not headless driver (by default Firefox must be installed)

install `chromedriver` to use Selenium with Chrome browser
(see [below](#customizing-drivers) on how to change browser for Selenium):

```sh
$ brew install chromedriver
```

#### Capybara-webkit

- `capybara-webkit` gem
- supports executing JS
- not pure headless driver (still relies on X11 being present in Linux)
- wraps QtWebKit
- requires Qt system libraries:

  ```sh
  $ brew install qt
  ```

#### Poltergeist

- `poltergeist` gem
- supports executing JS
- pure headless driver (no need for X11)
- wraps PhantomJS (uses QtWebKit but makes it purely headless)
- requires PhantomJS (installs QtWebKit as dependency):

  ```sh
  $ brew install phantomjs
  ```

require `capybara/poltergeist` in _rails_helper.rb_ to use it.

### customizing drivers

Capybara allows to override standard driver configuration:

```ruby
Capybara.register_driver :selenium do |app|
  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: :chrome)
end
```

or register customized standard driver as a new driver:

```ruby
Capybara.register_driver :selenium_chrome do |app|
  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: :chrome)
end
```

now it's possible to use `selenium_chrome` driver
whenever you would use a standard driver.

## DSL

- by default Capybara will only locate visible elements
- all searches are case-sensitive (because XPath is case-sensitive)

### RSpec method aliases

Capybara alias | RSpec method
---------------|---------------------------------
`feature`      | `describe ..., type: :feature`
`background`   | `before`
`scenario`     | `it`
`let`/`let!`   | `given`/`given!`

### finding elements

precedence of attributes (or texts) elements are found by:

found by   | element
-----------|--------------------------------------------------------
name       | inputs (file, checkbox, radio, text), textarea, select
id         | all
value      | inputs (submit, reset, image, button), button
label text | inputs (file, checkbox, radio, text), select
text       | button, link, select option
title      | inputs (submit, reset, image, button), button, link

when in doubt it's always possible to use valid CSS or XPath selector.

### selectors

CSS is default selector.

XPath selector can be specified inline:

```ruby
find(:xpath, '//ul/li').text
```

or set as default selector:

```ruby
Capybara.default_selector = :xpath
find('//ul/li').text
```

#### custom selectors

definition:

```ruby
Capybara.add_selector(:row) do
  xpath { |num| ".//tbody/tr[#{num}]" }
end

Capybara.add_selector(:flash_type) do
  css { |type| "#flash.#{type}" }
end
```

usage:

```ruby
find(:row, 3)
find(:flash_type, :notice)
```

### navigation

- `visit`:

  ```ruby
  visit('/projects')
  visit(post_comments_path(post))
  ```

### actions (clicking)

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions>

- `click_button`
- `click_link`
- `click_link_or_button` (also: `click_on`)

### actions (interacting with forms)

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions>

common actions:

- `fill_in` (fill text input or textarea)
- `choose` (mark radio button as checked)
- `check` / `uncheck` (mark checkbox as checked or unchecked)
- `select` (select particular option from select box)
- `attach_file` (attach file given its path)

### matchers (querying)

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Matchers>

matchers check if page or current node have specified elements or text.

generic Capybara matchers:

- `has_selector?` (`has_xpath?`/`has_css?`)
- `has_text?` (also: `has_content?`)

specific matchers (not all):

- `has_field?`
- `has_link?`
- `has_button?`

all Capybara matchers have corresponding Capybara RSpec matchers:

- `has_selector?` -> `have_selector`
- `has_text?` -> `have_text`

### finders

<http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Finders>

finders like actions or matchers use selectors to find elements.

generic finders:

- `find` to find one element
- `all` to find all elements

**NOTE**: generic finders accept only valid CSS or XPath selectors
          (they don't find by text or attribute values)!

specific finders (not all):

- `find_field`
- `find_link`
- `find_button`
- `find_by_id`

### scoping

generic method is `within` - it uses selector to restrict actions
within a specific area of the page or node.

specific scoping methods:

- `within_fieldset`
- `within_table`

### scripting

**NOTE**: only if driver supports executing JS.

- `execute_script` (doesn't returt the result - for complicated scripts)
- `evaluate_script` (return the result of the script - for simple scripts)

```ruby
page.execute_script("$('body').empty()")
result = page.evaluate_script('4 + 4')
```

### modals

**NOTE**: only if supported by driver.

wrap code that produces modal in a block:

- `accept_alert` / `dismiss_alert`
- `accept_confirm` / `dismiss_confirm`
- `accept_prompt` / `dismiss_prompt`

example:

```ruby
accept_alert do
  click_link('Show Alert')
end
```

### debugging

- `save_and_open_page` - open page in browser as it currently is
- `print page.html` - get current state of DOM as a string
- `page.save_screenshot('screenshot.png')` - if supported by driver
- `save_and_open_screenshot` - if supported by driver

## matching

how Capybara finds elements is customized using 2 optios:

- `Capybara.exact`
- `Capybara.match`

### exactness (`Capybara.exact`)

- if `true` partial matches are not allowed
- false by default

can be set:

- in _rspec_helper.rb_:

  ```ruby
  Capybara.exact = true
  ```

- inline for particular test (overrides global value):

  ```ruby
  click_link("Password", exact: false)
  ```

### strategy  (`Capybara.match`)

- controls how Capybara behaves when multiple elements match a query

4 strategies:

- `first` - pick the 1st element that matches
- `one` - raise error if >1 element matches (default for Capybara 2.0.x)
- `smart` (default for current Capybara - 2.7.0):
  - `exact` is `true` (like `one`):
    1. try to find exact match - raise error if >1 element matches
  - `exact` is `false`:
    1. try to find exact match - raise error if >1 element matches
    2. try to find partial match - raise error if >1 element matches
- `prefer_exact` - pick the 1st exactly matching element (default for Capybara 1.x)

## transactions

for some drivers (Selenium) Capybara starts an actual HTTP server in
the same process but in a separate thread.
RackTest is not one of these drivers - it uses Rack interface to interact
with your application.

this might pose a problem when accessing DB since transactions are not
shared among threads - Capybara will not see changes made to DB.

solution: use truncation instead of transactions
(`database_cleaner` gem allows to use different strategies -
we still use `transaction` strategy since it's the fastest one).

## Ajax

Capybara waits for elements to appear on page - it retries finding the element
for a brief period of time (2 seconds by default) before giving up and throwing
error. this period can be adjusted:

```ruby
Capybara.default_max_wait_time = 5
```

these 2 statements are not the same:

```ruby
!page.has_xpath?('a')
page.has_no_xpath?('a')
```

the former checks presence of `<a>` immediately while the latter waits
for the asynchronous process to complete.

this doesn't concern Capybara RSpec matchers - these statements are equivalent:

```ruby
expect(page).not_to have_xpath('a')
expect(page).to have_no_xpath('a')
```

## calling remote servers

RackTest driver doesn't support calling remote servers -
in-process Rack applications only.

to work with remote server:

```ruby
Capybara.current_driver = :selenium
Capybara.app_host = 'http://www.google.com'
...
visit('/')
```

or else visit URL directly:

```ruby
visit('http://www.google.com')
```

if working with remote server it's not necessary to boot rack application -
you can configure Capybara not to do it automatically:

```ruby
Capybara.run_server = false
```

## gotchas

- match only path in specs - not full URL (that is use `_path` helpers)
  since domain is set to `example.com`
