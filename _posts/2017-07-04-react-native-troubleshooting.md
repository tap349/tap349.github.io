see [npm/Yarn - Tips]({% post_url 2017-11-19-npm-yarn-tips %}) for `npm_reset`.

try resetting cache first before googling the error:

```
$ react-native start --reset-cache
```

JS errors
---------

### Couldn't find preset "es2015"

emulator window:

```
SyntaxError: TransformError: <APP_DIR>/node_modules/shallowequal/index.js:
Couldn't find preset "es2015" relative to directory "<APP_DIR>/node_modules/shallowequal"
```

**solution**

it has turned out that `shallowequal` is the only module in _node_modules/_ that
configures Babel presets to use in its _package.json_:

```json
  "babel": {
    "presets": [
      "es2015"
    ]
  },
```

quick-and-dirty fix for both Android and iOS:

- remove offending section from _package.json_ of `shallowequal` package
- restart packager - no error
- get that section back
- restart packager - still no error

even if `shallowequal` package is removed from filesystem and installed again
the error no longer occurs - maybe the 'right' version of `shallowequal` package
is cached somewhere?

NOTE: still the error might occur the next time emulator is run.

[Android] the error might disappear after enabling hot reloading in emulator
(`<D-m>` â†’ `Enable Hot Reloading`) - enabling live reload has no effect.

[iOS] enabling hot reloading never helped - use the fix above.

all in all IDK why this error occurs and how to fix it in general.

***UPDATE***

1. <https://github.com/dashed/shallowequal/issues/11>
2. <https://github.com/dashed/shallowequal/commit/f515936c8a790fbc225add864265b6c82881c9b1>

bug was fixed in v1.0.2 by moving Babel settings to _.babelrc_ so that they are
not consumed by RN packager by default.

`react-side-effect` is the only package that depends on `shallowequal` package
(according to _package-lock.json_) => update `react-side-effect` to update its
dependencies (including `shallowequal`) to their latest version:

```sh
$ npm update react-side-effect
```

### React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child

device system log:

```
<Critical>: Unhandled JS Exception: React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child.
```

**solution**

1. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchablehighlight.html>

> TouchableHighlight must have one child (not zero or more than one).
> If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View.

### Maximum call stack size exceeded

device system log:

```
<Warning>: Warning: Cannot update during an existing state transition
(such as within `render` or another component's constructor).
Render methods should be a pure function of props and state;
constructor side-effects are an anti-pattern, but can be moved to
`componentWillMount`.
<Error>: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
<Critical>: Unhandled JS Exception: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
```

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37387351>

DON'T:

- dispatch Redux actions (`this.props.store.dispatch(...)`) or
- set component state (`this.setState(...)`)

in `render()` method or any other method that is called from `render()` method
(that is when component is being rendered) - this will cause an infinite loop.

for example, if you dispatch action when component is being rendered:

1. reducers update the store according to that action
2. parent component is re-rendered using `forceUpdate()`
  (in my case it's subscribed to store updates)
3. component is re-rendered too
4. action is immediately dispatched again (infinite loop)

to avoid infinite loop dispatch actions and set component state only in

- constructor or
- callbacks that are not immediately invoked when component is being rendered

### In next release empty section headers will be rendered

emulator window:

```
Warning: In next release empty section headers will be rendered. In this
release you can use 'enableEmptySections' flag to render empty section headers.
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-listview/issues/39#issuecomment-217073492>

> If you use cloneWithRows then you don't have sections and so there's no issue
> with section headers showing up. The confusing part is that even if you don't
> use sections, it will still throw the warning mentioning sections. In this
> case, you can just set enableEmptySections={true} and forget about it.

```jsx
<ListView
  enableEmptySections={true}
  ...
/>
```

### onEndReached event of ListView keeps on firing

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38531369>
2. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6002>
3. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/refreshcontrol.html>

don't nest `ListView` in `ScrollView` - this is what causes `onEndReached`
event to be triggered again and again.

in most cases it means not to use `ScrollView` at all if you have to use
`ListView`:

- if you use `refreshControl` property of `ScrollView` note that `ListView` has
  the same property
- if you use some header in `ScrollView` it's possible to render the very same
  header in `renderHeader` callback of `ListView`

### ListView becomes blank

when pushing another page and then going back to page with `ListView` the
latter becomes blank (nothing is rendered where `ListView` is supposed to
be rendered). at the same time adjacent components are rendered properly
(=> it's not that wrapped collection becomes empty).

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/8607>

```jsx
<ListView
  removeClippedSubviews={false}
  ...
/>
```

though I guess it's more of a hack than real solution.

### SyntaxError wallet.png: Unexpected character (1:0)

the error occurs sometimes after adding new icon or updating existing one.

**solution**

restart packager (`react-native start`) and reload application in emulator.

### Actions must be plain objects

emulator window:

```
Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions.
```

the error occurs when trying to dispatch a thunk (Thunk middleware is applied).

**solution**

I used curly braces instead of parens when defining thunk action creator:

```diff
- export const requestCreateAuthentication = (phone_number) => {
+ export const requestCreateAuthentication = (phone_number) => (
   (dispatch, getState, api) => {
     // ...
   }
- }
+ )
```

### TouchableOpacity ignores initial opacity

`TouchableOpacity` ignores `opacity` property - it's set only when application
is hot reloaded in emulator.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/12628>
2. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/8909>

according to these links the issue has been closed (that is fixed) but it
doesn't look like this (or maybe it's another but related issue).

anyway I've found a workaround - create nested `View` and set `opacity`
property on it instead of `TouchableOpacity` itself:

{% raw %}
```jsx
<TouchableOpacity>
  <View style={{opacity: 0.5}}>
    <Text>{title}</Text>
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```
{% endraw %}

### Unknown named module

the error occurs when trying to load image using `Image`.

device system log:

```
<Notice>: { [Error: Unknown named module: '~/components/_new/graphics/images/ion-ios-person.png'] ... }
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2481>

it turns out you cannot load images dynamically - provide static URI instead
(that is don't construct it dynamically, say, using variable interpolation):

{% raw %}
```jsx
<Image
  style={{height: 30, width: 35}}
  source={require('~/components/_new/graphics/images/ion-person-stalker.png')}
/>
```
{% endraw %}

### ScrollView with unbounded height doesn't grow on scrolling

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/43525913/3632318>

I use `ScrollView` as a top-level container - when all its content doesn't fit
on the screen (say, on iPhone 4s), the `ScrollView` doesn't grow when trying to
scroll down: hidden content becomes visible but overflows the container.

the solution is to use `flexGrow: 1` instead of `flex: 1` for container:

{% raw %}
```jsx
<ScrollView contentContainerStyle={{flexGrow: 1}} scrollEnabled={true}>
</ScrollView>
```
{% endraw %}

### TextInput inside TouchableOpacity intercepts touches

when `TouchableOpacity` wraps `TextInput` and the latter is pressed, `onPress`
callback of `TouchableOpacity` is not invoked.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14958#issuecomment-324237317>

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity onPress={this._handlePress}>
  <View pointerEvents='none'>
    <TextInput editable={false} />
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### `fontWeight={600}` is not applied to TextInput

the error occurs if Gill Sans font is used only - setting font weight works with
`Text` and when default font is used instead.

**solution**

TODO

### undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Sentry.options.logLevel')

device system log:

```
<Notice>: { [TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Sentry.options.logLevel')] ... }
```

**solution**

<https://github.com/getsentry/react-native-sentry/issues/237#issuecomment-330779566>:

```javascript
Sentry.config(<sentry_endpoint>);
if (!__DEV__) { Sentry.install(); }
```

### ScrollView content is partially hidden below when scrolled to the bottom

make sure that all `ScrollView` parents have `flex: 1`.

### ScrollView inside Modal doesn't respect `keyboardShouldPersistTaps='handled'`

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/10138>

make sure to set `keyboardShouldPersistTaps='handled'` on ALL parent
`ScrollView`s outside of `Modal`:

> <Modal> cares about its (scrollview) parent stack, I assumed it would be like
> if rendered on top level

this error seems to be reproduced only when `ScrollView` is rendered inside
`Modal`.

### Swiper image (child) is occasionally blank

this often happens, say, after removing the child (game in my application) -
adjacent game should become visible but blank area is shown instead.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper/issues/196#issuecomment-249540289>
2. <https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper/issues/609>
3. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/scrollview.html#removeclippedsubviews>

adding `removeClippedSubviews={false}` property to `Swiper` component seems
to solve the problem for the time being (AFAIU when this property is false,
all offscreen children are force rendered - this might be not suitable for
long lists but in my case all lists are short so it shouldn't be a problem).

***UPDATE***

still this doesn't help - the only solution that works thus far is
<https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper/issues/609#issuecomment-338190488>.

***UPDATE***

nothing of the above works )

consider using `react-native-snap-carousel` instead of `react-native-swiper`.

### TextInput jumps when added dynamically

**solution**

set `minHeight` and `initialHeight` properties:

```jsx
<TextInput
  value="foo"
  minHeight={20}
  initialHeight={20}
/>
```

### image uploading doesn't work in emulator

response from AWS:

```xml
<Error>
  <Code>MalformedPOSTRequest</Code>
  <Message>The body of your POST request is not well-formed multipart/form-data.</Message>
</Error>
```

emulator window:

```
[RNDebugger] Detected you've enabled Network Inspect and you're using `uri`
in FormData, it will be a problem if you use it for upload, please see the
documentation (https://goo.gl/yEcRrU) for more information.
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/blob/master/docs/network-inspect-of-chrome-devtools.md>

disable `Network Inspect`:

| Redux DevTools: RMB â†’ `Disable Network Inspect`

### Loading dependency graph, done.

`react-native start` hangs after `Loading dependency graph, done.` message.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/16798>

I'm not sure but maybe reinstalling Watchman helped to resolve the issue:

```sh
$ brew uninstall watchman
$ brew install watchman
```

iOS errors

### Could not parse the simulator list output

the error occurs after new Xcode has been downloaded (9.3 in my case):

```
$ react-native run-ios
Scanning folders for symlinks in <APP_DIR>/node_modules (43ms)
Found Xcode workspace iceperkapp.xcworkspace
dyld: Symbol not found: _SimDeviceBootKeyDisabledJobs

Could not parse the simulator list output
```

**solution**

1. <https://joelennon.com/resolving-could-not-parse-the-simulator-list-output-when-running-react-native-apps-on-ios-simulator>

launch Xcode and install additional required components when prompted.

### duplicate interface definition for class 'RCTView'

1. <https://github.com/shoutem/ui/issues/134>

| Xcode: `Issue navigator` â†’ `Buildtime`

```sh
> BVLinearGradient:
  > Semantic issue
    > Duplicate interface definition for class 'RCTView'
    > Property has a previous declaration
    ...
```

**solution**

outdated version of `react-native-linear-gradient` package was used (it provides
`LinearGradient` component).

<https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient>:

> Version 2.0 supports react-native >= 0.40.0

now in _package.json_:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "react-native": "^0.42.0",
    ...
    "react-native-linear-gradient": "^1.6.2"
    ...
  },
```

that is currently used version of `react-native-linear-gradient` package is not
even supposed to support this version of react-native.

there are 2 ways to solve the problem:

- manually edit files in `react-native-linear-gradient` package

  | Xcode: `Project navigator`

  replace old imports with new ones in all files inside
  _\<MY\_APP>/Libraries/BVLinearGradient.xcodeproj/BVLinearGradient/_:

  ```objc
  // old import
  //#import "RCTView.h"
  // new import
  #import <React/RCTView.h>
  ```

- update `react-native-linear-gradient` package

  _package.json_:

  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "react-native-linear-gradient": "^2.0.0",
    ...
  },
  ```

  ```sh
  $ npm update react-native-linear-gradient
  ```

### Entry, ":CFBundleIdentifier", Does Not Exist

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/7308>

```sh
$ react-native run-ios
...
Print: Entry, ":CFBundleIdentifier", Does Not Exist
```

**solution**

error was gone after solving problem with `react-native-linear-gradient` package
(see above) and reinstalling all node modules.

### No bundle URL present

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12754>

emulator window:

```
No bundle URL present.

Make sure you're running a packager or have included a .jsbundle file in your
application bundle.
```

**solution**

it looks like application is run in emulator before packager is started.

run application again without closing emulator:

```sh
$ react-native run-ios
```

NOTE: the error usually occurs after running application in Android emulator.

### Native module cannot be null

1. <https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/issues/160>
2. <https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/issues/279>
3. <http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pushnotificationios.html>
4. <http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html>

packager log:

```sh
Native module cannot be null.
```

**solution**

the error occurred after installing `react-native-push-notification` package,
linking its native dependencies and trying to launch application:

```sh
$ npm install --save react-native-push-notification
$ react-native link react-native-push-notification
$ react-native run-ios
```

but it has turned out `PushNotificationIOS` library has not been linked to my
iOS project automatically (note there's no message about linking `iOS module`):

```sh
$ react-native link react-native-push-notification
Scanning 587 folders for symlinks in <APP_DIR>/node_modules (6ms)
npm-install info Android module react-native-push-notification is already linked
```

solution is to link `PushNotificationIOS` library manually as instructed in
[PushNotificationIOS](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pushnotificationios.html).

### excessive logging in device system log

that is when running `react-native log-ios`.

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37800790>
2. <https://github.com/bradmartin/nativescript-videoplayer/issues/76>

setting `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` and `OS_ACTIVITY_DT_MODE` environment variables in
Xcode project had no effect (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37800790>).

the only thing that helped to reduce the amount of logging output was exporting
`SIMCTL_CHILD_OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` environment variable in the shell before starting
application (<https://github.com/bradmartin/nativescript-videoplayer/issues/76>):

```sh
$ SIMCTL_CHILD_OS_ACTIVITY_MODE="disable" react-native run-ios
```

or else this variable can be exported for all shells in _~/.zshenv_:

```zsh
export SIMCTL_CHILD_OS_ACTIVITY_MODE="disable"
```

### Domain: NSURLErrorDomain, Error Code: -1200

`WebView` component's content when trying to open HTTPS URL:

```

2. <https://ste.vn/2015/06/10/configuring-app-transport-security-ios-9-osx-10-11/>
3. <https://github.com/vinhnx/iOS-notes/issues/1>

problem was solved by disabling forward secrecy support
for offending URL in _Info.plist_:

```diff
  ...
  <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
  <dict>
    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
      <key>localhost</key>

+       <false/>
+     </dict>
    </dict>
  </dict>
  ...
```

or else edit _Info.plist_ in Xcode:

### Library not loaded: .../CoreSimulator

the error occurred after updating Xcode from 8.2.1 to 9.2.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14342>

install additional components - you'll be prompted to install these components
when you first start Xcode after updating it.

### ld: library not found for -lFlurry-iOS-SDK

see also the tip `(how to) build application in Xcode` on why to open
workspace rather than a project when building application in Xcode.

still library might be really missing - in case you haven't linked it or
automatic linking by `react-native link` failed.

see the tip `(how to) link library with native dependencies manually` on
how to link library manually in the latter case.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1822#issuecomment-304815540>

```sh
$ cd ios
$ pod install
```

NOTE: all emulator options are omitted for brevity in examples below.

### Could not determine java version from '9.0.4'

the error occurs after updating to JDK 9:

```sh
$ react-native run-android
...
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine java version from '9.0.4'.
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/17688>
2. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/16536>

probably not the best but the easiest solution is to rollback to JDK 8:

```sh
$ brew cask uninstall java
$ brew tap caskroom/versions
$ brew cask install java8
```

***UPDATE (2019-07-11)***

`java8` formula is removed from `homebrew/cask-versions` repository - install
`adoptopenjdk8` formula instead:

```sh
$ brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
$ brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

### Failed to finalize session : INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE

the error occurs when trying to install application with lower version
(`versionCode` in _android/app/build.gradle_) on device that already has
this application installed with higher version:

### Qt library not found

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40931254>

```sh
$ emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23_x86_64
[140735129182208]:ERROR:./android/qt/qt_setup.cpp:28:Qt library not found at ../emulator/lib64/qt/lib
Could not launch '../emulator/qemu/darwin-x86_64/qemu-system-x86_64': No such file or directory
```

**solution**

it's necessary to cd to emulator directory and use relative path:

```sh
$ cd /usr/local/share/android-sdk/emulator
$ ./emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23_x86_64
```

or else create an alias in _~/.zshenv_:

```conf
export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-sdk

alias emulator='cd $ANDROID_HOME/emulator && ./emulator'
alias avd='emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23_x86_64'
```

***UPDATE***

after updating emulator to version 26.1.4.0 it's no longer necessary to cd to
emulator directory but still you cannot rely on `PATH` - use absolute path:

_~/.zshenv_:

```conf
alias avd='$ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23_x86_64'
# `Qt library not found` again:
#alias avd='emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23_x86_64'
```

### Cannot find AVD system path

NOTE: the error occurs sporadically and might disappear on its own.

```sh
$ emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23_x86_64
PANIC: Cannot find AVD system path. Please define ANDROID_SDK_ROOT
```

**solution**

_~/.zshenv_:

```conf
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/usr/local/share/android-sdk
```

### The SDK directory does not exist

```
$ react-native run-android
...
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> The SDK directory '/Users/tap/Library/Android/sdk' does not exist.
```

**solution**

if you previously used Android Studio to run application it might have created
_android/local.properties_ file in project with the following content:

```conf
sdk.dir=/Users/tap/Library/Android/sdk
```

that is RN now expects Android SDK to be installed in _~/Library/Android/sdk/_
(this is where Android Studio would install it).

there are 2 ways to solve the problem:

- create symlink that points to actual Android SDK root:

  ```sh
  $ mkdir ~/Library/Android
  $ ln -s $ANDROID_HOME ~/Library/Android/sdk
  ````

  or edit _android/local.properties_ directly:

  ```
  # export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/share/android-sdk
  sdk.dir=/usr/local/share/android-sdk
  ```

- just comment out or remove that line

  RN will search for Android SDK in `$ANDROID_HOME` then.

since these variables (`MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE`, etc.) are mentioned in
_android/app/build.gradle_ project file and build fails if they were not set.

### no application launcher icon on home screen in emulator

1. <https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_launcher.html>

application doesn't have launcher icon on home screen in emulator.

`react-native run-android` installs application but doesn't add application
launcher icon on home screen - you can do it manually:

- go to applications
- click and hold application icon
- drag application icon to home screen

so the problem is that application must be using both new AndroidX and old
Android Support libraries - hence the error.

it's possible to examine all application dependencies using this command:

```sh
$ cd android
$ ./gradlew app:dependencies
```

AFAIU there can be either `com.android.support` or `androidx.*` libraries in
the output but not both.

the reason why AndroidX libraries leak into current application dependencies
is that many RN libraries use the latest versions of Google libraries instead
of specific ones, say (note `+` symbol):

```groovy
// https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/blob/c4c961cf3a76bffe4e9e36cf00201611eecbb898/android/build.gradle

dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '+')}"
    // ...
    implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:${safeExtGet('firebaseVersion', '+')}"
}
```

but the latest versions of Google started to depend on AndroidX libraries since
June 17th, 2019 and it was a breaking change.

there might be several solutions to this problem:

#### [RECOMMENDED] try upgrading RN packages

1. <https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage/issues/128#issuecomment-505423631>

maybe maintainers of RN packages have fixed their _build.gradle_ files to use
specific versions of Google libraries:

```sh
$ yarn upgrade --pattern react-native
```

it was the case with `react-native-device-info` package:

> <https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/693>
>
> With the latest firebase/gcm release, the latest version (+) now brings in
> androidx dependencies. react-native won't be ready for androidx until 0.60
> so constrain the gcm version to 16.1.0 (the latest pre-androidx version).

```diff
  # https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/693/files#diff-7ae5a9093507568eabbf35c3b0665732

  dependencies {
    implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:${safeExtGet('reactNativeVersion', '+')}"
-   implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '+')}"
+   implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '16.1.0')}"
```

#### fork RN packages

1. <https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/693>

if RN package is not actively maintained it might take a long time till it's
fixed, so it makes sense to fork and fix it by yourself (just like it's done
in the linked PR which is also mentioned previously).

NOTE: you can open a PR to the upstream repository from a fork.

#### force use of specific versions of Google libraries

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25292#issuecomment-502998885>
2. <https://medium.com/@suchydan/how-to-solve-google-play-services-version-collision-in-gradle-dependencies-ef086ae5c75f>
3. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25307#issuecomment-503516458>
4. <https://medium.com/mindorks/avoiding-conflicts-in-android-gradle-dependencies-28e4200ca235>

in this solution it's not necessary to modify Google libraries but your own
_android/app/build.gradle_ file only.

perform these steps for each RN package which depends on AndroidX libraries
until there are no AndroidX dependencies (run `gradlew app:dependencies` to
find such RN packages as described above):

- find Google libraries in RN package dependencies

  libraries inside `com.google.android.gms` and `com.google.firebase` groups
  are affected:

  ```groovy
  // https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/blob/c4c961cf3a76bffe4e9e36cf00201611eecbb898/android/build.gradle

  dependencies {
      // ...
      implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '+')}"
      // ...
      implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:${safeExtGet('firebaseVersion', '+')}"
  }
  ```

- exclude these libraries from RN package dependencies in your application

  ```diff
    // android/app/build.gradle

    dependencies {
  -     implementation project(':react-native-push-notification')
  +     implementation(project(':react-native-push-notification')) {
  +       exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-gcm'
  +       exclude group: 'com.google.firebase', module: 'firebase-messaging'
  +     }
  ```

- use specific versions of these libraries in your application

  ```diff
    // android/app/build.gradle

    dependencies {
        // ...
  +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:16.1.0") {
  +       force = true;
  +     }
  +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:16.2.0") {
  +       force = true;
  +     }
  +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:16.1.0") {
  +       force = true;
  +     }
  +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-stats:16.0.1") {
  +       force = true;
  +     }
  +     implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:18.0.0") {
  +       force = true;
  +     }
  +     implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-iid:18.0.0") {
  +       force = true;
  +     }
    }
  ```

  a rule of thumb is not to use June versions, the last but one versions will
  do in most cases.

  see [Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) for the list of library
  versions and corresponding release dates.

  it might be necessary to force versions of both direct and transitive RN
  package dependencies (just like in example above) - inspect the output of
  `gradlew app:dependencies` command after adding all direct dependencies.

in brief RN package is using component which is not available in API level 23
(this API level is specified in _android/build.gradle_ file of that RN package).

=> increase API level supported by RN package (either fork RN packaged yourself
or find a fork where it has been already done):

```diff
  // android/build.gradle

  android {
-   compileSdkVersion 23
-   buildToolsVersion "23.0.1"
+   compileSdkVersion 28
+   buildToolsVersion "28.0.1"

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
-       targetSdkVersion 22
+       targetSdkVersion 28
    }
```

### Cannot find module X

```sh
$ react-native start
...
> node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start

module.js:487
    throw err;
    ^

Error: Cannot find module 'xmldoc'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:485:15)
```

and similar errors when some module cannot be found.

**solution**

use yarn instead of npm (somehow it managed to install all required dependencies):

```sh
$ rm package-lock.json
$ rm -rf node-modules
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### DeviceInfo native module is not installed correctly

**solution**

rebuild application.

### Unhandled JS Exception: undefined is not an object

emulator window:

```
Unhandled JS Exception: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'PropTypes.shape')
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/jsierles/react-native-audio/issues/83>

first I tried to upgrade RN again:

```sh
$ react-native upgrade
...
You should consider using the new upgrade tool based on Git. It makes upgrades easier by resolving most conflicts automatically.
To use it:
- Go back to the old version of React Native
- Run "npm install -g react-native-git-upgrade"
- Run "react-native-git-upgrade"
See https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html
```

as advised I ran:

```sh
$ npm install -g react-native-git-upgrade
$ react-native-git-upgrade
```

`react-native-git-upgrade` command downgraded `react` package to another alpha
version and this is what most likely fixed the issue.

```

**solution**

for each package that fails to compile:

- bump its version in _package.json_ (preferably to the latest one)
- `npm install`
- `npm updated <package_name>`

if it doesn't help, try to unlink/link failing package manually:

```sh
$ react-native unlink <package_name>
$ react-native link <package_name>
```

2. <https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/issues/626#issuecomment-358018994>

```sh
$ rm ./node_modules/react-native/local-cli/core/__fixtures__/files/package.json
$ react-native start
```

it looks like this file is recreated after each application build so it makes
sense to add this command to `postinstall` script in _package.json_:

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start",
    "test": "jest",
    "eslint": "eslint",
    "flow": "flow",

```

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/32950454/3632318>

`react-native-autogrow-textinput` is built with `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=9.3`
build setting but the rest of the project (the library is linked to later) has
been built with `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=8.0` build setting => hence the error.

the latest version of `react-native-autogrow-textinput` doesn't support iOS
Deployment Target (DT) lower than 9.3 but current DT in iOS project is 8.0 =>
change DT in iOS project to 9.3 as well:

in this case and in case of many other weird JS errors first try resetting cache:

```
$ react-native start --reset-cache
```

### We ran "xcodebuild" command but it exited with error code 65

**solution**

1. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies>
2. <https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/621#issuecomment-473346430>

incorrect version of `React` pod was installed into _ios/Pods/_ as a dependency
of `RNCAsyncStorage` pod:

```ruby
# node_modules/@react-native-community/async-storage/RNCAsyncStorage.podspec

Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name         = "RNCAsyncStorage"
  # ...

  s.dependency 'React'
end
```

there are 2 problems here:

- version of `React` pod is incorrect (0.11.0 but should be 0.59.9)
- `React` pod shouldn't be installed into _ios/Pods/_ at all (see below why)

now fix both problems:

- configure CocoaPods dependencies correctly

  see [React Native - iOS]({% post_url 2017-05-25-react-native-ios %}) for the
  tip on how to configure CocoaPods dependencies.

- remove `React` pod from _ios/Pods/_ directory

  since `RNCAsyncStorage` pod has `path` option in _ios/Podfile_ (which points to
  corresponding package location in _node\_modules/_ directory), it shouldn't be
  installed into _ios/Pods/_ - as well as its dependencies (that is `React` pod).

  but directory for `React` pod is still there and _ios/Pods/React/package.json_
  collides with _node\_modules/react-native/package.json_ as both have the same
  `name` field - `react-native`.

  it happened because `pod install` doesn't remove unused pods from _ios/Pods/_
  => it should be done manually by deintegrating your project:

  ```
  $ cd ios
  $ pod deintegrate
  Deintegrating `iceperkapp.xcodeproj`
  Deleted 1 'Copy Pods Resources' build phases.
  Deleted 1 'Check Pods Manifest.lock' build phases.
  - libPods-iceperkapp.a
  - Pods-iceperkapp.debug.xcconfig
  - Pods-iceperkapp.release.xcconfig
  Deleting Pod file references from project
  - libPods-iceperkapp-tvOSTests.a
  - libPods-iceperkappTests.a
  Deleted 1 empty `Pods` groups from project.
  Removing `Pods` directory.

  Project has been deintegrated. No traces of CocoaPods left in project.
  Note: The workspace referencing the Pods project still remains.
  ```

  or just by removing _ios/Pods/_ directory:

  ```sh
  $ rm -rf ios/Pods
  ```

  finally install pods again:

  ```sh
  $ cd ios
  $ pod install
  ```

### no known class method for selector 'didReceiveRemoteNotification:'

**solution**

```diff
  // ios/iceperkapp/AppDelegate.m

**solution**

find and replace all occurrences of `sentry-cli-binary` with `@sentry/cli` in
your project.

### The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 7.0

```
$ react-native run-ios
...
info warning: The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 7.0, but the range of supported deployment target versions for this platform is 8.0 to 12.2.99. (in target 'InAppUtils')
```

**solution**

> if the target is built for 9.0, then the Pods should build for 9.0, not for

> platform
>
> Specifies the platform for which a static library should be built, but NOT the
> deployment target for which it should be built (the number in platform :ios,
> '9.0' is only to find a compatible version of the pod). The actual deployment
> target will be lower than specified, will have unused symbols and will cause
> you a lot of headache.

```ruby
# node_modules/react-native-in-app-utils/react-native-in-app-utils.podspec

Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  # ...
  s.platform        = :ios, "7.0"
end
```

```ruby
# ios/Podfile

platform :ios, '9.0'
```

Podspecs and Podfile both specify deployment target for which a static library
should be built. still deployment target in Podfile is not the minimum allowed
deployment target => deployment target from Podspec might be used which will
cause warnings like above if that deployment target is not supported by Xcode.

=> ignore this warning for now.

### withRef is removed

emulator window:

```
Unhandled JS Exception: withRef is removed. To access the wrapped instance,
use a ref on the connected component
```

**solution**

1. <https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect#forwardref-boolean>

> <https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v6.0.0>
>
> The withRef option to connect has been replaced with forwardRef. If
> {forwardRef : true} has been passed to connect, adding a ref to the connected
> wrapper component will actually return the instance of the wrapped component.

> <https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1291#issuecomment-494188070>
>
> Basically, change withRef to forwardRef, and then delete the .getWrappedInstance()
> part of componentRef.getWrappedInstance(). componentRef is your own component now.

say:

```diff
  // MyComponent.js

  export default connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    null,
    null,
-   {withRef: true},
+   {forwardRef: true},
  )(MyComponent);
```

usage:

```diff
  <MyComponent ref={ref => this._myComponentRef = ref} />

  // ...
- this._myComponentRef.getWrappedInstance().save();
+ this._myComponentRef.save();
```
