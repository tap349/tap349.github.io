## troubleshooting

### `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?`

just install docker app via `brew cask` - not all the tools in isolation via `brew`
(it must be possible to configure all the tools manually but I guess a single
docker app does all the heavy lifting for you):

`$ brew cask install docker`
