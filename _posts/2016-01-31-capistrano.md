- It's just SSH
  Everything in Capistrano comes down to running SSH commands on remote servers.

- Key-based SSH
  Capistrano depends on connecting to your server(s) with SSH using key-based (i.e. password-less) authentication.

- Not for provisioning
  Server provisioning steps are not done by Capistrano.
