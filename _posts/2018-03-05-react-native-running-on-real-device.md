see [React Native - Notes]({% post_url 2017-05-30-react-native-notes %}) for
description of debug and release modes.

## iOS

- it's not necessary to uninstall existing application from device like for
  Android (and it doesn't matter how existing application was installed - via
  App Store or TestFlight) - it will be replaced with a build run from Xcode
- make sure notebook and real device use the same Wi-Fi network
- open _\<project_name>.xcworkspace_
- select real device as the build target in Xcode toolbar
- connect to development server

  change server address for development environment: development server is now
  available by notebook's local IP address - not `localhost`.

  ```diff
    // app/api/ApiHelpers.js

    const DEVELOPMENT_BASE_URL = Platform.OS === 'ios'
  -   ? 'http://localhost:3000'
  +   ? 'http://192.168.0.50:3000'
      : 'http://10.0.2.2:3000';
  ```

- build and run application

  | Xcode                |
  | -------------------- |
  | `â–¶` (toolbar button) |

## Android

- uninstall application from device if it's already installed from Google Play

  or else you'll get `INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION` error:

  ```
  $ react-native run-android
  ...
  Installing APK 'app-debug.apk' on 'GT-I9500 - 5.0.1' for app:debug
  04:27:39 E/SplitApkInstaller: Failed to finalize session : INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION:
    Package com.iceperkapp attempting to redeclare permission com.iceperkapp.permission.C2D_MESSAGE already owned by com.iceperkapp
  ```

- enable `USB debugging` and plug in real device via USB
- make sure real device is listed in `adb devices` output

  ```
  $ adb devices
  List of devices attached
  emulator-5554 device
  4d00af1d6fa7306d device
  ```

- connect to development server

  1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/43277765/3632318>

  forward port (Android 5.0+ only):

  ```
  $ adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000
  ```

  now local `3000` port is mapped to mobile's `3000` port.

  `3000` is the port development server is listening on (accordingly it's
  specified as development server port in _app/api/ApiHelpers.js_).

  it's not required to forward `8081` port which is used to communicate with
  packager - this is done automatically when you run application:

  ```sh
  $ react-native run-android
  ...
  Running /usr/local/share/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb -s 4d00af1d6fa7306d reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
  ```

  also change server address for development environment: development server is
  now available by both `localhost` and notebook's local IP address (but not
  `10.0.2.2` or `10.0.3.2` - like in case of emulator).

  ```diff
    // app/api/ApiHelpers.js

    const LOCALHOST = Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? 'http://localhost:3000'
  -   : 'http://10.0.2.2:3000';
  +   : 'http://localhost:3000';
  ```

- build and run application

  running `react-native run-android` will install application on all devices
  listed in `adb devices` output - say, both real device and emulator (it's safe
  to close emulator).

## troubleshooting

### notebook's local IP is unreachable

IDK why it happens - maybe because of some router settings.

**solution**

use ngrok (not tested for Android - anyway `localhost` should work thanks to
port forwarding):

```diff
  // app/api/ApiHelpers.js

  const LOCALHOST = Platform.OS === 'ios'
-   ? 'http://localhost:3000'
+   ? 'http://b27357e9.ngrok.io'
    : 'http://localhost:3000';
```
