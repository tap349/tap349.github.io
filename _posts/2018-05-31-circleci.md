troubleshooting
---------------

### build is not starting after changes are pushed to Github

**solution**

there was an error in my CircleCI config - `version: 2` key was missing in
`workflows` section.

to find specific error open current branch of your project in CircleCI -
you'll see a big yellow `NEED SETUP` button in case there are any errors
in your config.
