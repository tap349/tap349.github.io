notes for both iOS and Android
------------------------------

- when running application in debug mode:

  - `__DEV__` variable is set to true
  - Developer Menu is available - shake real device to access it
  - hot reloading works as a rule (use live reload if it doesn't)
  - you can debug JS remotely - select `Debug JS Remotely` in Developer Menu
    to open React Native Debugger

- when running application in release mode
  (same as installing APK or TestFlight build):

  - `__DEV__` variable is set to false
  - Developer Menu is not available
  - hot reloading and live reload don't work
  - you cannot debug JS remotely

all in all these combinations of environment and build configuration are
possible in both iOS and Android:

- development + debug
- production + debug
- production + release

the value of `__DEV__` variable is determined by current build
configuration (debug or release) - not by current environment.

iOS
---

- it's not necessary to uninstall existing application from device
  like for Android (and it doesn't matter how existing application
  was installed - via App Store, TestFlight or whatever) - it will
  be replaced with a build run from Xcode
- make sure notebook and real device use the same Wi-Fi network
- open _\<project_name>.xcworkspace_
- select real device as the build target in Xcode toolbar
- connect to development server

  change server address for development environment: development server
  is now available by notebook's local IP address - not `localhost`.

  _app/api/ApiHelpers.js_:

  ```diff
    const LOCALHOST = Platform.OS === 'ios'
  -   ? 'http://localhost:3000'
  +   ? 'http://192.168.0.36:3000'
      : 'http://10.0.2.2:3000';
  ```

  _app/api/graphql/run.js_:

  ```diff
    const DEVELOPMENT_BASE_URL = Platform.OS === 'ios'
  -   ? 'http://localhost:3000'
  +   ? 'http://192.168.0.36:3000'
      : 'http://10.0.2.2:3000';
  ```

- build and run application

  | Xcode: `â–¶` (button in toolbar)

Android
-------

- uninstall application from device if it's already installed from Google Play

  or else you'll get `INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION` error:

  ```
  $ react-native run-android
  ...
  Installing APK 'app-debug.apk' on 'GT-I9500 - 5.0.1' for app:debug
  04:27:39 E/SplitApkInstaller: Failed to finalize session : INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION:
    Package com.iceperkapp attempting to redeclare permission com.iceperkapp.permission.C2D_MESSAGE already owned by com.iceperkapp
  ```

- enable `USB debugging` and plug in real device via USB
- make sure real device is listed in `adb devices` output

  ```
  $ adb devices
  List of devices attached
  emulator-5554 device
  4d00af1d6fa7306d device
  ```

- connect to development server

  1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/43277765/3632318>

  forward port (Android 5.0+ only):

  ```
  $ adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000
  ```

  now local `3000` port is mapped to mobile's `3000` port.

  `3000` is the port development server is listening on
  (accordingly it's specified as development server port in
  both _app/api/ApiHelpers.js_ and _app/api/graphql/run.js_).

  it's not required to forward `8081` port which is used to
  communicate with packager - this is done automatically when
  you run application:

  ```sh
  $ react-native run-android
  ...
  Running /usr/local/share/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb -s 4d00af1d6fa7306d reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
  ```


  also change server address for development environment: development
  server is now available by both `localhost` and notebook's local IP
  address (but not `10.0.2.2` - like in case of emulator).

  _app/api/ApiHelpers.js_:

  ```diff
    const LOCALHOST = Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? 'http://localhost:3000'
  -   ? 'http://10.0.2.2:3000'
  +   : 'http://localhost:3000';
  ```

  _app/api/graphql/run.js_:

  ```diff
    const DEVELOPMENT_BASE_URL = Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? 'http://localhost:3000'
  -   ? 'http://10.0.2.2:3000'
  +   : 'http://localhost:3000';
  ```

- build and run application

  running `react-native run-android` will install application on all
  devices listed in `adb devices` output - say, both real device and
  emulator (it's safe to close emulator).
