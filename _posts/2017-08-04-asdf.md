### install asdf

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf
$ echo 'source ~/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
```

don't install `asdf` via brew because:

- brew formula places asdf files into _/usr/local/opt/asdf/_

  it would be necessary to source _/usr/local/opt/asdf/asdf.sh_ instead of
  _~/.asdf/asdf.sh_ while according to official asdf docs it's required to
  source the latter.

- asdf just doesn't work

  in case of Elixir (maybe this is the case with other languages as well):
  after installing plugin and setting current version, `elixir` executable
  is not found if asdf is installed via brew.

### install plugin

`PLUGIN` is a language like `elixir` or `ruby`:

```sh
$ asdf plugin-add PLUGIN
$ asdf list-all PLUGIN
$ asdf install PLUGIN 1.0.0
$ asdf global PLUGIN 1.0.0
$ asdf current PLUGIN
```

installed plugins and their versions are stored in _~/.asdf/installs/_.

#### Elixir

uninstall system Elixir before adding Elixir plugin:

```sh
$ brew uninstall --force elixir
$ rm -rf ~/.mix/
$ rm -rf ~/.asdf/
```

#### Ruby

1. <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby#migrating-from-another-ruby-version-manager>

add support for existing _.ruby-version_ files after adding Ruby plugin:

```conf
# ~/.asdfrc

legacy_version_file = yes
```

use _.ruby-version_ for legacy projects and _.tool-versions_ for new ones.

### .tool-versions

> <https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-configuration?id=tool-versions>
>
> Add a .tool-versions file to your project dir and versions of those tools
> will be used. Global defaults can be set in the file $HOME/.tool-versions.

`asdf global` command writes specified tool version to _~/.tool-versions_.
