## reload/restart Nginx

for some reason restarting Nginx service using init.d script doesn't work
(most likely `start-stop-daemon` used internally doesn't stop it correctly):

```sh
$ sudo service nginx restart
```

instead it's possible to restart Nginx manually:

- send `reload` signal

  this reloads Nginx configuration only without restarting service itself:

  ```sh
  $ cd /opt/nginx-1.2.9/sbin/
  $ ./nginx -s reload
  ```

- or else send `stop` signal and start Nginx service as usual

  ```sh
  $ cd /opt/nginx-1.2.9/sbin/
  $ ./nginx -s stop
  $ sudo service nginx start
  ```

## proxy POST requests

POST requests are passed to proxy just like GET requests, no additional
configuration is required.
