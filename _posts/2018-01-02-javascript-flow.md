installation
------------

### install Flow locally

```sh
$ yarn add flow-bin --dev
```

### install Babel preset for Flow plugins

```sh
$ yarn add babel-preset-flow --dev
```

add preset to _.babelrc_:

```
{
  "presets": ["flow"]
}
```

> Now, Babel will always strip away Flow source and your JS runtime can
> interpret the code. This is especially important for feeding into ESlint.

### install `eslint-plugin-flowtype` ESLint plugin

```sh
$ yarn add eslint-plugin-flowtype --dev
```

_.eslintrc.yml_:

```yaml
extends:
  - 'plugin:flowtype/recommended'
plugins:
  - flowtype
```

<https://github.com/ryyppy/flow-guide#eslint-configuration>:

> there will be some warnings about unused variables whenever you
> write type declarations. The eslint plugin eslint-plugin-flowtype
> will mute those warnings.

I don't see any warnings mentioned above but this plugin is
still useful: say, it adds ESLint rule to check for presence
of Flow declaration (`// @flow`) if type annotation is added
to the file - ESLint will complain if declaration is missing:

```
Type annotations require valid Flow declaration.
(flowtype/no-types-missing-file-annotation)
```

this rule `flowtype/no-types-missing-file-annotation` must be a
part of recommended configuration (`plugin:flowtype/recommended`).

NOTE: `eslint-plugin-flowtype` plugin is ESLint plugin - it's
      not meant to check for Flow type errors or to show them!
      checking for type errors is performed by `flow` binary
      (use either `flow status` in terminal or `flow` syntastic
      JS checker in Vim).

configuration
-------------

### generate Flow config

```sh
$ $(npm bin)/flow init
```

this will create empty _.flowconfig_ at project root.

usage
-----

### flag files to be checked with `// @flow`

`@flow` annotation can be placed anywhere in JS file -
it just instructs Flow to check current file.

it's possible to use `@flow weak` for weak mode
(see <https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/3316>) -
e.g. it allows not to specify types for all parameters.

### add Flow script

_package.json_:

```json
"scripts": {
  "flow": "flow"
},
```

now Flow can be run with any of these commands:

```sh
$ $(npm bin)/flow
$ yarn run flow
```

### run Flow

```sh
# same as `flow status` - starts Flow server (if not started yet),
# does a full check, prints the results and monitors changes to
# your code in the background checking those changes incrementally
# for errors - current errors can be shown by typing `flow` again
$ yarn run flow
# does a full check in the foreground without starting Flow server
$ yarn run flow check
```

Vim integration
---------------

### syntastic

NOTE: for syntastic `flow` checker to be available
      and enabled Flow must be installed globally
      (just like for ESLint)!

_~/.vim/vimrc_:

```vim
let g:syntastic_javascript_flow_exe = '$(npm bin)/flow'
let g:syntastic_javascript_checkers = ['flow']
```

### `vim-flow` plugin

syntastic already performs linting of JS files so linting
provided by this plugin (automatic or manual checks - via
`FlowMake` command) seems to be superfluous.

still `FlowJumpToDef` and `FlowType` commands might be useful -
just make sure to disable automatic checks on save!
