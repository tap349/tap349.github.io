pack (Webpacker term) == entry (Webpack term)

### notes

#### about environments

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/webpack.md>

<https://github.com/rails/webpacker>:

NODE_ENV values:

- production
- development

assets are compiled in NODE_ENV mode but use/load RAILS_ENV configuration
(production environment is used as a fallback one) from _config/webpacker.yml_.

> binstubs compile in development mode, rake tasks compile in production mode:

```ruby
# compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified
./bin/webpack
./bin/webpack-dev-server

# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified
bundle exec rails assets:precompile
bundle exec rails webpacker:compile
```

#### about packs

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/assets.md>

<https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/581#issuecomment-316937091>:

> 'packs' is a special directory meant only for entry files i.e. written either
> in JS, Coffee or TS (as long as it compiles to JS). Every other thing should
> be outside packs and may live under app/javascript or anywhere you wish to
> be as long as you can reference it. If you reference styles in your pack all
> styles will be extracted to [pack_name].css, which you can reference in your
> views.

=> only JS files are allowed to be packs (entries), CSS files imported inside
packs will be extracted into `<pack_name>.css` which is meant to be referenced
in layout with `stylesheet_pack_tag` helper.

#### about loaders

<https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/webpack.md#loaders>:

> You can also modify the loaders that Webpacker pre-configures for you.

basic loaders are installed as dependencies of `@rails/webpacker` NPM package -
see _yarn.lock_:

```javascript
"@rails/webpacker@3.5":
  version "3.5.3"
  dependencies:
    babel-loader "^7.1.4"
    css-loader "^0.28.11"
    file-loader "^1.1.11"
    postcss-loader "^2.1.4"
    sass-loader "^6.0.7"
    style-loader "^0.20.3"
```

these loaders are also pre-configured by Webpacker (that is rules for loader
modules are added to _webpack.config.js_ Webpack config that must be generated
by Webpacker under the hood).

print `environment.loaders` property inside _config/webpack/environment.js_
for the list of configured loaders:

```diff
  const {environment} = require('@rails/webpacker');

+ console.log(environment.loaders);
  module.exports = environment;
```

### configuration

#### import required assets in packs

_app/assets/packs/app.js_:

```javascript
import 'css/app';
import 'js/app';
```

#### install additional plugins

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/assets.md#using-babel-module-resolver>

use `babel-plugin-module-resolver` to reference assets directly from
_app/assets/_:

```sh
$ yarn add babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

_.babelrc_:

```diff
{
  // ...
  "plugins": [
    "syntax-dynamic-import",
    "transform-object-rest-spread",
-   ["transform-class-properties", { "spec": true }]
+   ["transform-class-properties", { "spec": true }],
+   ["module-resolver", {
+     "root": ["./app/assets"]
+   }]
  ]
}
```

maybe using this plugin is not required since I can reference _css/app.js_
and _js/app.js_ inside my pack file (_app/assets/packs/app.js_) - that is
Webpacker understands that these paths are relative to `source_entry_path`
(_app/assets/_ - see _config/webpacker.yml_).
