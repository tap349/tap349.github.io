mocks
-----

1. <http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/>

> Passing the dependency as argument is much simpler and should be
> preferred over relying on configuration files and Application.get_env/3.
> When not possible, the configuration system is a good fallback.

> Another way to think about mocks is to treat them as nouns.
> You shouldnâ€™t mock an API (verb), instead you create a mock
> (noun) that implements a given API.
>
> When you use mock as a verb, you are changing something that
> already exists, and often those changes are global.
> When you use mock as a noun, you need to create something new,
> and by definition it cannot be the SomeDependency module because
> it already exists.

<https://github.com/plataformatec/mox/>:

when using `Mox.stub` it's almost the same as just defining mock module
except that we don't do it in our codebase polluting it with mock modules
(usually Mox mocks are stubbed inside tests or in _test_helper.exs_).

add _test/support/_ to compilation paths
----------------------------------------

1. <https://github.com/thoughtbot/ex_machina#install-in-just-the-test-environment-for-non-phoenix-projects>
2. <https://elixirforum.com/t/load-module-during-test/7400/2>

_mix.exs_:

```elixir
def project do
  [
    app: :my_app,
    # ...
    elixirc_paths: elixirc_paths(Mix.env)
  ]
end

defp elixirc_paths(:test), do: ["lib", "test/support"]
defp elixirc_paths(_), do: ["lib"]
```

run specific tests (same as `focus` in RSpec)
---------------------------------------------

- provide test path and line number to `mix test`

  ```sh
  $ mix test test/foo.exs:14
  ```

- use custom tag

  _test/foo.exs_:

  ```elixir
  @tag :wip
  test "run this test only" do
    assert true
  end
  ```

  ```sh
  $ mix test --only wip
  ```

show detailed information (same as `--format documentation` in RSpec)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

```sh
$ mix test --trace
```

`--trace` option also sets timeout to infinity - useful when using `IEx.pry`.

run tests synchronously
-----------------------

`async: true` has no effect - useful in case of race conditions.

```sh
$ mix test --trace
```

use IEx.pry in tests
--------------------

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/34863997/3632318>

to make pry work in tests run `mix test` in IEx session:

```sh
$ iex -S mix test
```

in my case `iex` is aliased to `iex -S mix` so type just `iex test`.

NOTE: test will time out after 60000ms by default:

```
** (ExUnit.TimeoutError) test timed out after 60000ms. You can change the timeout:

  1. per test by setting "@tag timeout: x"
  2. per case by setting "@moduletag timeout: x"
  3. globally via "ExUnit.start(timeout: x)" configuration
  4. or set it to infinity per run by calling "mix test --trace"
     (useful when using IEx.pry)

Timeouts are given as integers in milliseconds.
```

setup vs. setup_all
-------------------

`context` variable in `setup_all` doesn't have `test` key:

```elixir
%{case: MyApp.FooTest, module: MyApp.FooTest}
```

this makes sense since `setup_all` is run before the whole suite -
not before each test.

use Logger in tests
-------------------

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/36349341/3632318>

_config/test.exs_:

```elixir
- config :logger, level: :warn
+ config :logger, level: :info
```

this will print all info messages in tests:

```elixir
Logger.info("foo")
```

pass params in controller tests
-------------------------------

1. <https://medium.com/@lasseebert/test-driving-a-phoenix-endpoint-part-i-b53e300c1a0a>

params can be specified as either keyword list or map:

```elixir
conn = get(conn, webhook_path(conn, :show), %{"hub.mode" => "subscribe"})
# or
conn = get(conn, webhook_path(conn, :show), ["hub.mode": "subscribe"])
```

> * test/models/user_test.exs - you will test your changeset and others.
> Again, only data transformation, tests can be "async: true" because it
> doesn't talk to the database.
>
> * test/models/user_repo_test.exs - you will test anything the model
> returns that needs the repository to be tested, like complex queries.
> Here it makes no sense to mock because you *need* the repo, testing a
> complex query against a fake repo makes no purpose. Also, since it
> depends on the Repo, tests cannot be concurrent (until Ecto 1.1 where
> we solve this problem)
>
> * test/views/user_test.exs - you will test how your views are rendered.
> Again, it is only data transformation, so tests can be "async: true"
> because it doesn't talk to the database.
>
> * test/controllers/user_controller_test.exs - integration layer. You'll
> test a simple pass through the different layers and the expected result.
> Important: you are not going to test "models" and "views" combinations here.
> For example, you won't test that when you POST attributes A and B, field C
> will be added to the model. That's is going to be in the model test. In the
> same way you are not going to test how users with different attributes are
> rendered. That's in the view test.
