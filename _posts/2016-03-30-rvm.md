## sourcing

sourcing rvm:

```sh
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
```

after installation rvm adds this line automatically to many rc files.

source rvm twice:

- in _.zlogin_ for zsh
- in _.profile_ for macvim (<https://rvm.io/integration/vim>)

remove rvm sourcing from everywhere else.

*NOTE*: don't source rvm in _.zshenv_ because in that case
        rvm doesn't switch to its default ruby in new zsh session.

## PATH

I modified `PATH` in 2 locations (IDK if it's strictly necessary):

- in _.zshenv_:

  ```sh
  path=(~/.rvm/bin ~/scripts ~/scripts/git /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /bin /sbin $path)
  ```

- in _.profile_:

  ```sh
  PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin
  ```
