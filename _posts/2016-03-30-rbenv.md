moving from RVM to rbenv: migration guide.

<!-- more -->

1. <https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv>
2. <http://makandracards.com/makandra/21545-rbenv-how-to-switch-to-another-ruby-version-temporarily-per-project-or-globally>

takeaways:

- rbenv stores Ruby versions in _~/.rbenv/versions/_
- global (default) Ruby version is stored in _~/.rbenv/version_
- rbenv uses Ruby version from _.ruby-version_ if it's present

uninstallation of RVM
---------------------

- remove RVM directory:

  ```sh
  $ rvm implode
  ```

  or else just:

  ```sh
  $ rm -rf ~/.rvm
  ```

- remove _~/.rvmrc_
- remove RVM source line from all rc files

  some of them were created by RVM purely for adding this line -
  remove such rc files completely

- remove _~/.rvm/bin/_ from `PATH` (in my case - in _~/.zshenv_ and _~/.profile_)

installation
------------

- install rbenv and Ruby:

  ```sh
  $ brew install rbenv
  $ rbenv init
  $ rbenv install --list
  $ rbenv install 2.3.0
  $ rbenv global 2.3.0
  ```

  to uninstall Ruby version (and remove its gems):

  ```sh
  $ rbenv uninstall 2.3.0
  ```

- update list of available Ruby versions

  list of available Ruby versions is updated by upgrading ruby-build -
  rbenv plugin installed as dependency for homebrew rbenv package:

  ```sh
  $ brew upgrade ruby-build
  ```

- install bundler and other global gems
  (make sure you're using `gem` shim - not _/usr/bin/gem_ from system Ruby):

  ```sh
  $ gem install bundler
  $ cd ~/.dotfiles && bundle
  ```

- run `bundle` inside each project's directory
  (it might be necessary to restart pow so that it could find new gems)

configuration
-------------

source in _~/.zshrc_:

```sh
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

usage
-----

1. <http://makandracards.com/makandra/21545>

- `rbenv version` - show current Ruby version
- `rbenv versions` - list all installed Ruby versions
- `RBENV_VERSION=system irb` - set Ruby version for current command only
- `rbenv shell system` - set Ruby version for current shell only<br>
  (`RBENV_VERSION` environment variable is set to specified version)
- `rbenv local 2.3.0` - set Ruby version for current project<br>
  (specified version is written to _.ruby-version_ file in current directory)
- `rbenv global 2.3.0` - set global Ruby version for current user<br>
  (used by default unless version is specified with `RBENV_VERSION` or _.ruby-version_)

### bundler and spring

see [bundler and spring]({% post_url 2016-03-31-bundler-and-spring %}) for details.

### pow

1. <https://github.com/basecamp/pow/wiki/Troubleshooting#rbenv>

create _~/.powconfig_:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:/usr/local/opt/rbenv/bin:$PATH"
```

check where _bin/_ is located - this is _/usr/local/opt/rbenv/bin/_
if rbenv has been installed with brew.

don't forget to restart pow (or `kill -9` process better).

### command-t

switch to system Ruby when compiling `command-t` vim plugin in _~.vim/update_bundles_:

```ruby
puts "compiling command-t..."

# https://langui.sh/2014/03/10/wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future-is-a-harsh-mistress
environment = 'ARCHFLAGS="-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future"'
command_t_path = File.join 'command-t', 'ruby', 'command-t'
rbenv_init_script = 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"'
command_t_build_script = 'rbenv shell system && ruby extconf.rb && make'

puts `zsh -c 'cd #{command_t_path} && #{rbenv_init_script} && #{environment} #{command_t_build_script}'`
```

if you install Ruby with `brew` (`brew install ruby`) it will be used as
system Ruby by rbenv and `command-t` won't work since it expects
its native extensions to be compiled with vim Ruby version (2.0.0p648).

### Chef

#### ChefDK and rbenv

1. <https://dwradcliffe.com/2014/09/19/chefdk-with-rbenv.html>
2. <http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/71258>

background info:

- ChefDK stores its binaries (`berks`, `chef`, `knife`, etc.) in _/opt/chefdk/bin/_
- rbenv prepends shims directory to `PATH` in _~/.zshrc_ (`eval "$(rbenv init -)"`)
- loading order of zsh startup files: _~/.zshenv_ → _~/.zshrc_ → _~/.zlogin_
  (see also [Zsh startup files]({% post_url 2017-03-07-zsh-startup-files %}))

if you install `knife-solo` gem, rbenv will create a `knife` shim - it will
always point to executable from this gem and will make `knife` executable
from ChefDK unavailable.

3 ways to solve this problem:

- *[RECOMMENDED]* set ChefDK environment for current command only

  1. <https://github.com/chef/chef-dk#chef-exec>

  ```zsh
  $ chef exec knife zero converge 'name:billing'
  ```

  ```zsh
  $ which knife
  /usr/local/bin/knife
  $ chef exec which knife
  /opt/chefdk/bin/knife
  ```

  =>

  - `knife` points to rbenv shim
  - use `chef exec knife` to access ChefDK executable

- set ChefDK environment for current shell session or permanently

  1. <https://github.com/chef/chef-dk#chef-shell-init>

  for current shell session:

  ```zsh
  $ eval "$(chef shell-init zsh)"
  ```

  permanently in _~/.zshenv_:

  ```zsh
  eval "$(chef shell-init zsh)"
  ```

  =>

  - `knife` points to ChefDK executable
  - use `bundle exec knife` to access rbenv shim

- prepend ChefDK paths to `PATH` environment variable

  _~/.zlogin_:

  ```zsh
  path=(/opt/chefdk/bin $path)
  ```

  _/opt/chefdk/bin_ must be prepended to `PATH` in _~/.zlogin_
  because the latter is sourced after _~/.zshrc_ where shims
  directory is also prepended to `PATH`.

  =>

  - `knife` points to ChefDK executable
  - use `bundle exec knife` to access rbenv shim

#### `ruby_rbenv` cookbook

RVM cannot be installed on Debian 8 with `rvm` cookbook -
installing rbenv with `ruby_rbenv` cookbook went smoothly.

recipe:

```ruby
include_recipe 'ruby_build'
include_recipe 'ruby_rbenv::user'
```

attribute file:

```ruby
override['rbenv']['user_installs'] = [
  {
    'user' => 'deploy',
    'rubies' => ['2.3.0'],
    'global' => '2.3.0',
    'gems' => {
      '2.3.0' => [
        { 'name' => 'bundler' }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

**NOTE**: `bundler` gem is not installed by default.

### Capistrano

1. <https://github.com/capistrano/rbenv>

this gem provides rbenv support for Capistrano:
it allows to use rbenv managed rubies on target machine.

_Capfile_:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/rbenv'
```

_config/deploy.rb_:

```ruby
set :rbenv_type, :user
set :rbenv_ruby, File.read('.ruby-version').strip
set :rbenv_prefix, "RBENV_ROOT=#{fetch(:rbenv_path)} RBENV_VERSION=#{fetch(:rbenv_ruby)} #{fetch(:rbenv_path)}/bin/rbenv exec"
set :rbenv_map_bins, %w(rake gem bundle ruby rails)
set :rbenv_roles, :all
```

troubleshooting
---------------

### shim is not created after gem is installed

to diagnose the problem run rehashing manually
(rehashing synchonizes shims with installed gems):

```sh
$ rbenv rehash
rbenv: cannot rehash: /Users/tap/.rbenv/shims/.rbenv-shim exists
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/issues/759>

obviously solution is to remove _.rbenv-shim_ file:

```sh
$ rm /Users/tap/.rbenv/shims/.rbenv-shim
```
