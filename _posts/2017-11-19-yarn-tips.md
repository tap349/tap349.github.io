install package globally
------------------------

```sh
$ yarn global add rnpm
$ which rnpm
/usr/local/bin/rnpm
```

- global packages are stored in _~/.config/yarn/global/_
- global packages are saved to _~/.config/yarn/global/package.json_
  (only when installed with Yarn)

run script or locally installed executable
------------------------------------------

- scripts are defined in `scripts` section of _package.json_
- locally installed executables are stored in _node\_modules/.bin/_
  (`$(npm bin)`) - say, `eslint` or `jest`
