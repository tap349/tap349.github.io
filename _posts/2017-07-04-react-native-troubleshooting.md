Couldn't find preset "es2015"
-----------------------------

emulator window:

```
SyntaxError: TransformError: <app_dir>/node_modules/shallowequal/index.js:
Couldn't find preset "es2015" relative to directory "<app_dir>/node_modules/shallowequal"
```

**solution**

it has turned out that `shallowequal` is the only module in _node_modules/_ that
configures Babel presets to use in its _package.json_:

```json
  "babel": {
    "presets": [
      "es2015"
    ]
  },
```

quick-and-dirty fix for both Android and iOS:

- remove offending section from _package.json_ of `shallowequal` package
- restart packager - no error
- get that section back
- restart packager - still no error

even if `shallowequal` package is removed from filesystem and installed again
the error no longer occurs - maybe the 'right' version of `shallowequal` package
is cached somewhere?

NOTE: still the error might occur the next time emulator is run.

[Android] the error might disappear after enabling hot reloading in emulator
(`<D-m>` â†’ `Enable Hot Reloading`) - enabling live reload has no effect.

[iOS] enabling hot reloading never helped - use the fix above.

all in all IDK why this error occurs and how to fix it in general.

***UPDATE***

1. <https://github.com/dashed/shallowequal/issues/11>
2. <https://github.com/dashed/shallowequal/commit/f515936c8a790fbc225add864265b6c82881c9b1>

bug was fixed in v1.0.2 by moving Babel settings to _.babelrc_ so that they are
not consumed by RN packager by default.

`react-side-effect` is the only package that depends on `shallowequal` package
(according to _package-lock.json_) => update `react-side-effect` to update its
dependencies (including `shallowequal`) to their latest version:

```sh
$ npm update react-side-effect
```

React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child
--------------------------------------------------------------------

device system log:

```
<Critical>: Unhandled JS Exception: React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child.
```

**solution**

1. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchablehighlight.html>

> TouchableHighlight must have one child (not zero or more than one).
> If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View.

errors after upgrading RN to 0.45.1
-----------------------------------

### Cannot find module X

```sh
$ react-native start
...
> node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start

module.js:487
    throw err;
    ^

Error: Cannot find module 'xmldoc'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:485:15)
```

and similar errors when some module cannot be found.

**solution**

use yarn instead of npm (somehow it managed to install all required dependencies):

```sh
$ rm package-lock.json
$ rm -rf node-modules
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

### DeviceInfo native module is not installed correctly

emulator window:

```
DeviceInfo native module is not installed correctly
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info/issues/176>

rebuild application.

### Unhandled JS Exception: undefined is not an object

emulator window:

```
Unhandled JS Exception: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'PropTypes.shape')
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/jsierles/react-native-audio/issues/83>

first I tried to upgrade RN again:

```sh
$ react-native upgrade
...
You should consider using the new upgrade tool based on Git. It makes upgrades easier by resolving most conflicts automatically.
To use it:
- Go back to the old version of React Native
- Run "npm install -g react-native-git-upgrade"
- Run "react-native-git-upgrade"
See https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html
```

as advised I ran:

```sh
$ npm install -g react-native-git-upgrade
$ react-native-git-upgrade
```

`react-native-git-upgrade` command downgraded `react` package to
another alpha version and this is what most likely fixed the issue.

Maximum call stack size exceeded
--------------------------------

device system log:

```
<Warning>: Warning: Cannot update during an existing state transition
(such as within `render` or another component's constructor).
Render methods should be a pure function of props and state;
constructor side-effects are an anti-pattern, but can be moved to
`componentWillMount`.
<Error>: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
<Critical>: Unhandled JS Exception: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
```

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37387351>

DON'T:

- dispatch Redux actions (`this.props.store.dispatch(...)`) or
- set component state (`this.setState(...)`)

in `render()` method or any other method that is called from `render()` method
(that is when component is being rendered) - this will cause an infinite loop.

for example, if you dispatch action when component is being rendered:

1. reducers update the store according to that action
2. parent component is re-rendered using `forceUpdate()`
  (in my case it's subscribed to store updates)
3. component is re-rendered too
4. action is immediately dispatched again (infinite loop)

to avoid infinite loop dispatch actions and set component state only in

- constructor or
- callbacks that are not immediately invoked when component is being rendered

In next release empty section headers will be rendered
------------------------------------------------------

emulator window:

```
Warning: In next release empty section headers will be rendered. In this
release you can use 'enableEmptySections' flag to render empty section
headers.
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-listview/issues/39#issuecomment-217073492>

> If you use cloneWithRows then you don't have sections and so there's no issue
> with section headers showing up. The confusing part is that even if you don't
> use sections, it will still throw the warning mentioning sections. In this
> case, you can just set enableEmptySections={true} and forget about it.

```jsx
<ListView
  enableEmptySections={true}
  ...
/>
```

onEndReached event of ListView keeps on firing
----------------------------------------------

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38531369>
2. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/6002>
3. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/refreshcontrol.html>

don't nest `ListView` in `ScrollView` - this is what
causes `onEndReached` event to be triggered again and again.

in most cases it means not to use `ScrollView` at all if you have
to use `ListView`:

- if you used `refreshControl` property of `ScrollView` note
  that `ListView` has the same property
- if you used some header in `ScrollView` it's possible to render
  the very same header in `renderHeader` callback of `ListView`

ListView becomes blank
----------------------

when pushing another page and then going back to page with `ListView`
the latter becomes blank (nothing is rendered where `ListView` is
supposed to be rendered). at the same time adjacent components are
rendered properly (=> it's not that wrapped collection becomes empty).

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/8607>

```jsx
<ListView
  removeClippedSubviews={false}
  ...
/>
```

though I guess it's more of a hack than real solution.

SyntaxError wallet.png: Unexpected character (1:0)
--------------------------------------------------

the error occurs sometimes after adding new icon or updating existing one.

**solution**

restart packager (`react-native start`) and reload application in emulator.

### Module JSTimersExecution is not a registered callable module

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45594935>

emulator window:

```
Module JSTimersExecution is not a registered callable module (calling callTimers)
```

**solution**

rebuild application.

Actions must be plain objects
-----------------------------

emulator window:

```
Actions must be plain objects. Use custom middleware for async actions.
```

the error occurs when trying to dispatch a thunk (Thunk middleware is applied).

**solution**

I used curly braces instead of parens when defining thunk action creator:

```diff
-export const requestCreateAuthentication = (phone_number) => {
+export const requestCreateAuthentication = (phone_number) => (
  (dispatch, getState, api) => {
    // ...
  }
-}
+)
```

TouchableOpacity ignores initial opacity
----------------------------------------

`TouchableOpacity` ignores `opacity` property -
it's set only when application is hot reloaded in emulator.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/12628>
2. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/8909>

according to these links the issue has been closed (that is fixed) but
it doesn't look like this (or maybe it's another but related issue).

anyway I've found a workaround - create nested `View` and set
`opacity` property on it instead of `TouchableOpacity` itself:

{% raw %}
```jsx
<TouchableOpacity>
  <View style={{opacity: 0.5}}>
    <Text>{title}</Text>
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```
{% endraw %}

Unknown named module
--------------------

the error occurs when trying to load image using `Image`.

device system log:

```
<Notice>: { [Error: Unknown named module: '~/components/_new/graphics/images/ion-ios-person.png'] ... }
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2481>

it turns out you cannot load images dynamically - provide static URI instead
(that is don't construct it dynamically, say, using variable interpolation):

{% raw %}
```jsx
<Image
  style={{height: 30, width: 35}}
  source={require('~/components/_new/graphics/images/ion-person-stalker.png')}
/>
```
{% endraw %}

ScrollView with unbounded height doesn't grow on scrolling
----------------------------------------------------------

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/43525913/3632318>

I use `ScrollView` as a top-level container - when all its content
doesn't fit on the screen (say, on iPhone 4s), the `ScrollView`
doesn't grow when trying to scroll down: hidden content becomes
visible but overflows the container.

the solution is to use `flexGrow: 1` instead of `flex: 1` for container:

{% raw %}
```jsx
<ScrollView contentContainerStyle={{flexGrow: 1}} scrollEnabled={true}>
</ScrollView>
```
{% endraw %}

TextInput inside TouchableOpacity intercepts touches
----------------------------------------------------

when `TouchableOpacity` wraps `TextInput` and the latter is pressed,
`onPress` callback of `TouchableOpacity` is not invoked.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14958#issuecomment-324237317>

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity onPress={this._handlePress}>
  <View pointerEvents='none'>
    <TextInput editable={false} />
  </View>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

`fontWeight={600}` is not applied to TextInput
-----------------------------------------------

the error occurs if Gill Sans font is used only - setting font
weight works with `Text` and when default font is used instead.

**solution**

TODO

undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Sentry.options.logLevel')
-----------------------------------------------------------------

device system log:

```
<Notice>: { [TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Sentry.options.logLevel')] ... }
```

**solution**

<https://github.com/getsentry/react-native-sentry/issues/237#issuecomment-330779566>:

```javascript
Sentry.config(<sentry_endpoint>);
if (!__DEV__) { Sentry.install(); }
```

ScrollView content is partially hidden below when scrolled to the bottom
------------------------------------------------------------------------

make sure that all `ScrollView` parents have `flex: 1`.

ScrollView inside Modal doesn't respect `keyboardShouldPersistTaps='handled'`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/10138>

make sure to set `keyboardShouldPersistTaps='handled'` on
ALL parent `ScrollView`s outside of `Modal`:

> <Modal> cares about its (scrollview) parent stack,
> I assumed it would be like if rendered on top level

this error seems to be reproduced only when `ScrollView` is
rendered inside `Modal`.

### Error: While resolving module `react-native-vector-icons/Octicons`

```sh
$ react-native start
...
error: bundling failed: Error: While resolving module `react-native-vector-icons/Octicons`, the Haste package `react-native-vector-icons` was found. However the module `Octicons` could not be found within the package. Indeed, none of these files exist:

  * `<app_dir>/node_modules/react-native/local-cli/core/__fixtures__/files/Octicons/index(.native||.ios.js|.native.js|.js|.ios.json|.native.json|.json)`
```

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/issues/626#issuecomment-357405396>
2. <https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/issues/626#issuecomment-358018994>

```sh
$ rm ./node_modules/react-native/local-cli/core/__fixtures__/files/package.json
$ react-native start
```

it looks like this file is recreated after each application build so it
makes sense to add this command to `postinstall` script in _package.json_:

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start",
    "test": "jest",
    "eslint": "eslint",
    "flow": "flow",
+   "postinstall": "rm -f ./node_modules/react-native/local-cli/core/__fixtures__/files/package.json"

### CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "react-native-contacts"

```sh
$ pod install

Specs satisfying the `react-native-contacts (from `../node_modules/react-native-contacts`)` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
```

**solution**

<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html>:

> If your iOS project is using CocoaPods (contains Podfile) and linked library
> has podspec file, then react-native link will link library using Podfile.

pods were added to _ios/Podfile_ after linking corresponding libraries:

```diff

```

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/32950454/3632318>

error explanation: `react-native-autogrow-textinput` library is
built with `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=9.3` build setting but
the rest of the project (the library is linked to later) has been
built with `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=8.0` build setting =>
hence the error.

the latest version of `react-native-autogrow-textinput` doesn't support
iOS Deployment Target (DT) lower than 9.3 but current DT in iOS project
is 8.0 => change DT in iOS project to 9.3 as well:

Swiper image (child) is occasionally blank
------------------------------------------

this often happens, say, after removing the child (game in my application) -
adjacent game should become visible but blank area is shown instead.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper/issues/196#issuecomment-249540289>
2. <https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper/issues/609>
3. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/scrollview.html#removeclippedsubviews>

adding `removeClippedSubviews={false}` property to `Swiper` component seems
to solve the problem for the time being (AFAIU when this property is false,
all offscreen children are force rendered - this might be not suitable for
long lists but in my case all lists are short so it shouldn't be a problem).

***UPDATE***

still this doesn't help - the only solution that works thus far is
<https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper/issues/609#issuecomment-338190488>.

***UPDATE***

nothing of the above works )

consider using `react-native-snap-carousel` instead of `react-native-swiper`.

TextInput jumps when added dynamically

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/7046#issuecomment-443397899>

try updating corresponding npm package:

```
$ npm uninstall babel-preset-flow
$ npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-flow
```

```diff
  // babel.config.js

  module.exports = {
-   presets: ['flow']
+   presets: ['@babel/preset-flow']
  };
```

**solution**

1. <https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial#connecting-the-components>

> <https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy#babel--7x>
>
> This plugin is specifically for Babel 6.x. If you're using Babel 7, this plugin

but after having tried all possible combinations of `decoratorsBeforeExport` and
`legacy` options I still couldn't make new decorators work. so:

> We do not recommend using connect as a decorator, because the spec is unstable.

=> it's easier not to use decorators at all (and remove all related packages),
the more especially as it's a recommended approach.

**solution**

1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21154#issuecomment-439348692>

in this case and in case of many other weird JS errors first try resetting cache:

```
$ react-native start --reset-cache
```
