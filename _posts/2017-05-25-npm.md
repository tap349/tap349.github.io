## tips

### reinstall all packages

```sh
$ npm prune
$ npm cache clean
$ npm install
```

### `--save` vs `--save-dep` options

both options allow to save packages as dependencies in _packages.json_
when running `npm install`:

- `--save` saves packages as dependencies in `"dependencies": {...}`
  (application cannot run without them)
- `--save-dev` saves packages as development dependencies in `"devDependencies": {...}`
  (they are used in development environment only - say, test suites or transpilers)
