> Components accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return
> React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

components can be defined using plain function or ES6 class:

```javascript
// functional component
function Welcome (props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// class component
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

elements can also represent user-defined components:

```javascript
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

> When React sees an element representing a user-defined component,
> it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object called "props".

> Components must return a single root element.

> if part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel) or is complex enough
> on its own (App, Comment), it is a good candidate to be a reusable component.

> All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

<https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html>:

class components have additional features: local state and lifecycle hooks.
