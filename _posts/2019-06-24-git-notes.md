upstream
--------

say, you create a new branch and push it into remote repository:

```sh
$ git checkout -b foo
$ git push
```

TODO: read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37770467/37770591 again
      (and add it to resources)
TODO: `git push` creates foo and origin/foo branches but foo has no upstream:

TODO: get it clear with all possible variations of `git push` with and without
      remote and branch name (now `git push` just works for remote branch:
      most likely origin/foo is created but no upstream is set)

TODO: get it clear with `git push -u`
      (https://stackoverflow.com/a/6089415/3632318 and add it to resources if
      it's useful)

phrase for setting upstream (use it in description):

> ~/dev/compleader/alice (master) Â» g branch -u origin/master
> Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.

also it might be necessary to set upstream if it's missing:

- for existing branch

  1. `git help branch`

  ```sh
  $ git branch -u origin/master master
  ```

  to set upstream for current branch:

  ```sh
  $ git branch -u origin/master
  ```

- for existing or new branch

  1. `git help push`

  ```sh
  $ git push -u
  ```
