installation
------------

- install Flow globally

  ```sh
  $ brew install flow
  ```

- install Babel preset for Flow plugins

  ```sh
  $ yarn add babel-preset-flow --dev
  ```

  add preset to _.babelrc_:

  ```
  {
    "presets": ["flow"]
  }
  ```

  > Now, Babel will always strip away Flow source and your JS runtime can

- install `eslint-plugin-flowtype` ESLint plugin

  <https://github.com/ryyppy/flow-guide#eslint-configuration>:

  > there will be some warnings about unused variables whenever you
  > write type declarations. The eslint plugin eslint-plugin-flowtype
  > will mute those warnings.

  I don't see any warnings mentioned above but this plugin is
  still useful: say, when type annotation is added to the file
  but Flow declaration (`@flow`) is missing, ESLint complains
  once the plugin is installed:

  ```
  Type annotations require valid Flow declaration.
  (flowtype/no-types-missing-file-annotation)
  ```

  this rule `flowtype/no-types-missing-file-annotation` must be a
  part of recommended configuration (`plugin:flowtype/recommended`).

  NOTE: `eslint-plugin-flowtype` plugin is ESLint plugin - it's
        not meant to check for Flow type errors or to show them!
        checking for type errors is performed by `flow` binary
        (use either `flow status` in terminal or `flow` syntastic
        JS checker in Vim).

usage
-----

- prepare project

  ```sh
  $ flow init
  ```

  this will create empty _.flowconfig_ at project root.

- flag files to be checked with `// @flow`

  `@flow` annotation can be placed anywhere in JS file -
  it just instructs Flow to check current file.

  it's possible to use `@flow weak` for weak mode
  (see <https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/3316>) -
  it allows not to specify types for all parameters.

- run Flow

  ```sh
  # same as `flow status` - starts Flow server (if not started yet),
  # does a full check, prints the results and monitors changes to
  # your code in the background checking those changes incrementally
  # for errors - current errors can be shown by typing `flow` again
  $ flow
  # does a full check in the foreground without starting Flow server
  $ flow check
  ```

Vim integration
---------------

- syntastic

  _~/.vim/vimrc_:

  ```vim
  let g:syntastic_javascript_checkers = ['eslint', 'flow']
  ```

- `vim-flow` plugin

  syntastic already performs linting of JS files so linting
  provided by this plugin (automatic or manual checks - via
  `FlowMake` command) seems to be superfluous.

  still `FlowJumpToDef` and `FlowType` commands might be useful -
  just make sure to disable automatic checks on save!
