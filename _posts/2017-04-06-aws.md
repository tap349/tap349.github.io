think of some name that you would use throughout all the services that
identifies your project - say, foo.<br>
then name Amazon resources as follows:

- bucket: foo.bucket
- policy: foo.policy
- user: foo.user

## account (aka AWS account)

create Amazon account if you don't have one (this is a single
account for all Amazon services including shop itself).

### account identifiers

1. <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html>

each AWS account is assigned 2 unique IDs:

- AWS account ID (used to construct ARNs)
- canonical user ID (used for cross-account access to S3 bucket)

later these IDs can be found as follows (from any service):

> \<your_name\> (menu in top right corner) ->
>   My Security Credentials -> Accound Identifiers

### generate access keys

these keys (just like the keys of any service created in IAM service) can be
used to make programmatic requests to AWS services (say, to S3 service).

> \<your_name\> (menu in top right corner) ->
>   My Security Credentials ->
>   Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) ->
>   Create New Access Key (button)

NOTE: save generated credentials (`Access Key ID` and `Secret Access key`) -
      secret access key won't be available later (just like in IAM service).

## [S3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2)

### access bucket

1. <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html>

- virtual-hosted-style URL:

  - `http://foo.bucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
  - `http://foo.bucket.s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`

- path-style URL:

  - `http://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/foo.bucket`
  - `http://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/foo.bucket`

both ways are equivalent except that when using virtual-hosted-style URLs:

- it's possible to omit region name (`http://foo.bucket.s3.amazonaws.com`) -
  request will be routed to appropriate region where bucket resides
- bucket name must be DNS-compliant

### create bucket

> 1) Name and region

- Bucket name: foo.bucket (must be unique across all buckets names in S3)
- Region: EU (Frankfurt) (closest to your location)

> 2) Set properties

leave default settings (`Versioning` and `Logging` are disabled).

> 3) Set permissions

give required permissions to users or groups (for `Object access` only).

permissions can also be managed after bucket creation:

> Permissions (tab) -> Access Control List (button)

giving all permissions to `Everyone` group still doesn't allow
anonymous user to access the bucket (neither read nor write) -
set bucket policy (see below) if you need to make bucket public.

TODO: why?

### grant read-only permission to anonymous user

1. <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-2>

> \<bucket\> -> Permissions (tab) -> Bucket Policy (button)

paste policy (specify actual bucket ARN) and save it:

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Sid":"AddPerm",
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::foo.bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2)

### create policy

> Policies (left sidebar) -> Create Policy (button)

> 1) Step 1: Create Policy

select `Create Your Own Policy`.

> 2) Step 2: Set permissions

omitted when creating your own policy.

> 3) Step 3: Review Policy

- `Policy Name`: foo.policy
- `Policy Document`: policy itself (specify actual bucket ARN)

### create user

> Users (left sidebar) -> Add user (button)

> 1) Details

- `User name`: foo.user
- `Access type`: [x] `Programmatic access`

> 2) Permissions

- select `Attach existing policies directly`
- find and check foo.policy

> 3) Review

> 4) Complete

NOTE: save generated credentials (`Access Key ID` and `Secret Access key`) -
      secret access key won't be available later.

## awscli

- install `awscli`

  ```sh
  $ brew install awscli
  ```

- configure `aws`

  select the same [region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)
  as for S3 bucket.

  ```sh
  $ aws configure
  AWS Access Key ID: ***
  AWS Secret Access Key: ***
  Default region name: eu-central-1
  Default output format: None
  ```

- test copying to S3 bucket

  ```sh
  $ aws s3 cp test.txt s3://foo.bucket/
  upload: ./test.txt to s3://foo.bucket/test.txt
  $ aws s3 ls s3://foo.bucket/
  2017-04-07 03:14:59          4 test.txt
  $ aws s3 rm s3://foo.bucket/test.txt
  delete: s3://foo.bucket/test.txt
  ```

## troubleshooting

### error saving bucket policy (the policy must contain a valid version string)

1. <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=633020>

```sh
The policy must contain a valid version string
```

policy versions are not arbitrary strings - they are predefined by AWS.
