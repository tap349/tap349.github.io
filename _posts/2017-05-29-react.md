<https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html>:

> Components accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return
> React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

components can be defined using plain function or ES6 class.

elements can also represent user-defined components:

```javascript
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

> When React sees an element representing a user-defined component,
> it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object called "props".

> Components must return a single root element.

> if part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel) or is complex enough
> on its own (App, Comment), it is a good candidate to be a reusable component.

> All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
