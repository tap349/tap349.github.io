### Distillery

> Distillery is also great when working with Umbrella apps! There are really
> only two things you need to pay attention to:
>
> 1. Include the names of your child applications in the applications list
> of the Release configuration.
>
> 2. You can choose to take the Release version number from any of the child
> applications by using current_version(:my_child_app).
>
> As mentioned before, itâ€™s also possible to define more than one Release in
> your rel/config.exs and thus specify multiple Release profiles. This can be
> useful if you want to have Releases that only include certain child
> applications from your umbrella project.
