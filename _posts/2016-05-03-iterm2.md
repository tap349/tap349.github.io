iTerm2 tips and troubleshooting.

<!-- more -->

tips
----

### use Emacs keybindings (`<M-b>`/`<M-f>`) to navigate between words

| `Preferences` → `Profiles` → `Default` → `Keys` → `Keyword Behavior`

- `Left option key acts as`: `+Esc`

### paste from clipboard with right click

| `Preferences` → `General` → `Selection`

- [x] `Copy to pasteboard on selection`

| `Preferences` → `Pointer` → `Mouse Button & Trackpad Gesture Actions`

- `Right button single click`: `Paste from Clipboard`

### system-wide hotkey to switch to iTerm2

| `Preferences` → `Keys` → `Hotkey`

- [x] `Show/hide iTerm2 with a system-wide hotkey`
- `Hotkey`: `<C-D-t>`

troubleshooting
---------------

### problems with `rails console`

- random errors at startup:
  - `Cannot read termcap database; using dumb terminal settings.`
  - `No entry for terminal type "_DIR=/Users/tap/dev/pumba/bin"; using dumb terminal settings.`
  - etc.
- reverse search doesn't work
- no history between sessions

**solution**

```sh
$ brew uninstall readline
$ brew install readline
```

### very slow paste of text

the problem appeared after upgrading macOS from El Capitan to High Sierra:
when text is pasted into the terminal, there's a significant delay (it's
proportional to the length of text but, say, for 80 characters it might be
about 1 second) and then pasted text is automatically selected.

**solution**

1. <https://cirw.in/blog/bracketed-paste>
2. <http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Parameters.html>

it has turned out that this behaviour is called `bracketed paste mode`
and is meant to protect you from malevolent input: when bracketed paste
mode is disabled, pasted text is immediately executed but after turning
this mode on you have an opportunity to examine what you are going to
paste and then press `<CR>` to continue with pasting.

bracketed paste mode is supported by both iTerm2 and Zsh so it can be
turned off on any level (I'm turning it off because I'm not used to it
and because it introduces significant and annoying delay when pasting):

- iTerm2

  1. <https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/5698#note_27701613>

  | `Preferences` → `Profiles` → `Default` → `Keys`

  map `<D-v>` keyboard shortcut to `Paste..` action and disable
  `Bracketed paste mode` in action settings.

- Zsh

  1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/33456330/3632318>

  _~/.zshrc_:

  ```zsh
  unset zle_bracketed_paste
  ```

  ***UPDATE (2019-03-29)***

  1. <https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/issues/238>

  even though there is no delay before pasting text now, the text is still pasted
  very slowly - character by character (as if I'm just typing it very fast):

  it has turned out it's caused by `zsh-autosuggestions` plugin - this problem
  is now fixed so just update the plugin:

  {% raw %}
  ```sh
  $ cd ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
  $ git up
  ```
  {% endraw %}
