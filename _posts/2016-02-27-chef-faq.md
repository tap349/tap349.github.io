### how knife connects to node?

#### knife-solo

#####  bootstrapping

  it's possible to connect to node using:

  - domain or IP address

    current user is used unless it's specified explicitly
    (user@domain or user@ip).

    you are always prompted to enter password.

  - host or IP address from SSH config

    user is not automatically retrieved from corresponding SSH config entry
    when using host - it must be specified explicitly (user@host).

    passwordless authentication works if specified user and host or
    specified user and IP address match the ones from SSH config entry.

  knife-solo creates new node file in _nodes/_ after bootstrapping the node.

  node file name:

    - domain (when using domain/host to bootstrap the node)
    - IP address (when using IP address).

##### cooking

  when using knife-solo and chef-solo there is no chef server where
  information about nodes might be stored.
  that is why knife connects to node in the same way as described above
  for bootstraping.

  cooking:

  - chef repo is uploaded to _~/chef-solo/_ directory in
    specified user's home directory
  - chef-solo searches for node file in uploaded chef repo -
    node file name must be the same as domain or IP address used
    to connect to the node. if such node file is not found
    chef-solo creates a new one with empty run-list
  - chef-solo provisions the node using node file
    (it is created if it doesn't exist - see previous step)

#### knife-zero

#####  bootstrapping

  same as file for knife-solo except that it's possible to specify node
  name with `--node-name` option when bootstrapping the node.

##### cooking

  cooking differs since node configuration is stored inside local
  chef-zero server - changing host, domain or IP address in either SSH
  config or node file itself has no effect on cooking (converging).

  node configuration can be viewed with `knife node show NODE -z` command.
