synchronization button is missing
---------------------------------

synchronization button (`person` icon in toolbar next to address bar) is
missing after restarting Opera.

**solution**

so it must be okay it's not shown all the time - click this menu item to
force show it:

| Opera: Opera (top menu) â†’ Signed in as \<YOUR_EMAIL>

warning is not shown before quitting with <D-Q>
-----------------------------------------------

setting corresponding option `Show warning before quitting with <D-Q>` on
has no effect - if you close and open settings page again, this option is
reset to off again.

**solution**

set `Warn on closing browser window with multiple tabs` flag to `Enabled`.
