install package globally
------------------------

```sh
$ npm install semistandard -g
/usr/local/bin/semistandard -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/semistandard/bin/cmd.js
$ which semistandard
/usr/local/bin/semistandard
```

global packages are stored in _/usr/local/lib/node_modules/_.

reinstall all packages
----------------------

```sh
$ rm -rf node_modules/ && npm install
```

remove not used packages
------------------------

not used packages appear after removing packages from _package.json_ manually.

```sh
$ npm prune
```

`--save` vs. `--save-dev` options
---------------------------------

both options allow to save packages to _packages.json_ when running
`npm install`:

- `--save` saves packages as dependencies in `"dependencies"` section
  (application cannot run without them)
- `--save-dev` saves packages as development dependencies in
  `"devDependencies"` section (they are used in development
  environment only - say, test suites or transpilers)

don't use peer dependencies
---------------------------

1. <https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/>

do I need to use peer dependencies if I am not npm package author?

say, _node_modules/react-native-push-notification/package.json_:

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "react-native": ">=0.33"
},
```

so `react-native-push-notification` peer-depends on `react-native` -
what would happen if I use `react-native` of unsupported version:

1. as a depedency of my application?
2. as a peer dependency of my application?

- using `react-native` of unsupported version as a dependency

  _package.json_:

  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "0.30.0",
    "react-native-push-notification": "^3.0.0"
  },
  ```

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ...
  npm WARN react-native-push-notification@3.0.1 requires a peer of react-native@>=0.33 but none was installed.
  ```

  => `react-native@0.30.0` is installed while a peer dependency of
  `react-native-push-notification` is not.

- using `react-native` of unsupported version as a peer dependency

  _package.json_:

  ```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react-native": "0.30.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-push-notification": "^3.0.0"
  },
  ```

  ```sh
  $ npm install
  npm WARN myapp@0.0.1 requires a peer of react-native@0.30.0 but none was installed.
  npm WARN react-native-push-notification@3.0.1 requires a peer of react-native@>=0.33 but none was installed.
  ```

  => `react-native` is not installed at all - even I remove
  `react-native-push-notification` from the list of dependencies
  (no packages depend on specific version of `react-native` any more).

TL;DR:

don't use peer dependencies if you are not npm package author -
they are not automatically installed:

> peer dependencies are not automatically installed unless
> a dependent package explicitly depends on the peer package itself

so if you application depends on `react-native` package,
add it to `depedencies` along with its version.

another package (say, `react-native-foo`) that has `react-native`
as a peer dependency will be installed only if version constraints
of peer dependency are met by currently installed `react-native`.
