## useful commands

### systemctl

reload all unit files (do it every time after adding or modifying unit files):

```sh
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

start unit:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl start my-player.socket
```

enable unit (start automatically on boot):

```sh
$ sudo systemctl enable my-player.socket
```

show unit status (+ unit details and recent log entries):

```sh
$ sudo systemctl status my-player.socket
```

list active units by type:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl list-units --type socket
```

list all or specified units and show their state (enabled/disabled):

```sh
$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type socket
$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files 'ntv*'
```

poweroff or reboot system:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl poweroff
$ sudo systemctl reboot
```

### journalctl

useful options:

- `-b, --boot` - show entries for specified boot
  (for current boot if argument is empty)
- `-e, --pager-end` - jump to the end of the journal
  (implies `-n1000`)
- `--no-tail` - show all lines
  (undoes `-e` and `-n` options)
- `-f, --follow` - follow journal (just like `tail -f`)
- `--since today` - show entries since specified today
  (in the format `"2012-10-30 18:17:16"` or special string like `today`)
- `-u, --unit` - show entries for specified unit only

NOTE: be cautious when using `-e` and `-n` options:
      they might cause some lines not to be printed.

view recent entries with explanation messages:

```sh
$ sudo journalctl -xn
```

view journal for specified unit:

```sh
$ sudo journalctl -u my-player.service
```

view journal for multiple units at once
(entries are merged in chronological order):

```sh
$ sudo journalctl -u my-player.service -u my-player.socket
```

view journal for multiple units using wildcard:

```sh
$ sudo journalctl -u my-*.service
```

## creating custom unit file

- create _\<unit_name\>.\<type_extension\>_ file in _/etc/systemd/system_

  make sure it's a file - not symlink from somewhere else (even from your
  home directory). usually when unit is enabled systemd creates a symlink
  to unit file (located in _/etc/systemd/system_ for custom unit files)
  in _/etc/systemd/system/\<some_target\>.target.wants_ (as instructed in
  `[Install]` section of unit file).

  but if you create a symlink of unit file in _/etc/systemd/system_
  (instead of copying file itself) systemd for some reason considers
  it to be enabled (this is not what you always want - maybe you want
  that unit to be started by another unit using `Requires` directive
  or it's a socket-activated service).

- enable unit if necessary

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl enable <unit_name>.<type_extension>
  ```

## tips

### timer unit

- foo.service
- foo.timer

if using timer for associated service enable timer unit only -
associated service unit will be activated when the timer is reached:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl enable foo.timer
```

### socket unit

- foo.service
- foo.socket

if using socket-based activation of the service enable socket unit only -
associated service unit will be activated when anything is written to socket:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl enable foo.socket
```
