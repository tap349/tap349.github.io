## mocks

> Another way to think about mocks is to treat them as nouns.
> You shouldnâ€™t mock an API (verb), instead you create a mock
> (noun) that implements a given API.

> When you use mock as a verb, you are changing something that

<https://github.com/plataformatec/mox/>:

when using `Mox.stub` it's almost the same as just defining mock module
except that we don't do it in our codebase polluting it with mock modules
(usually Mox mocks are stubbed inside tests or in _test_helper.exs_).

## run specific tests (same as `focus` in RSpec)

- provide test path and line number to `mix test`

  ```sh
  $ mix test test/foo.exs:14
  ```

- use custom tag

  _test/foo.exs_:

  ```elixir
  @tag :wip
  test "run this test only" do
    assert true
  end
  ```

  ```sh
  $ mix test --only wip
  ```

## show detailed information (same as `--format documentation` in RSpec)

```sh
$ mix test --trace
```

`--trace` option also sets timeout to infinity - useful when using `IEx.pry`.

## run tests synchronously

`async: true` has no effect - useful in case of race conditions.

```sh
$ mix test --trace
```

## use IEx.pry in tests

to make pry work in tests run `mix test` in IEx session:

```sh
$ iex -S mix test
```

in my case `iex` is aliased to `iex -S mix` so type just `iex test`.

NOTE: test will time out after 60000ms by default:

```
** (ExUnit.TimeoutError) test timed out after 60000ms. You can change the timeout:

  1. per test by setting "@tag timeout: x"
  2. per case by setting "@moduletag timeout: x"
  3. globally via "ExUnit.start(timeout: x)" configuration
  4. or set it to infinity per run by calling "mix test --trace"
     (useful when using IEx.pry)

Timeouts are given as integers in milliseconds.
```
