## compilation

NOTE: use the same Ruby version to compile MacVim and Command-T!

### manually

1. <https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/wiki/Building>

if you don't specify Ruby version with `ASDF_RUBY_VERSION`, Ruby version from
_~/.tool-versions_ is used.

if system Ruby version and Ruby version from _~/.tool-versions_ differ, prefer
system Ruby because its version changes less frequently.

MacVim:

```sh
$ ASDF_RUBY_VERSION=system ./configure --enable-rubyinterp \
                                       --enable-pythoninterp \
                                       --enable-perlinterp \
                                       --enable-cscope
$ ASDF_RUBY_VERSION=system make
```

Command-T:

```sh
$ ASDF_RUBY_VERSION=system ruby extconf.rb && make
```

### via Homebrew

MacVim Homebrew formula has `ruby` dependency but current Ruby version in
Homebrew is 2.6.5. MacVim bottle (binary package) must have been compiled
against this Ruby version => it's necessary to install Ruby 2.6.5 locally
too to compile Command-T extension so that Ruby versions match.

MacVim:

```sh
$ asdf plugin-update ruby
$ asdf install ruby 2.6.5
$ asdf global ruby 2.6.5
$ brew install macvim
```

Command-T:

```sh
$ ruby extconf.rb && make
```

NOTE: even when building MacVim from source (`brew install macvim --HEAD`),
Ruby installed via Homebrew is used => it doesn't make sense to set specific
Ruby version with `ASDF_RUBY_VERSION` or via _~/.tool-versions_ - it will be
ignored.

## preferences

1. <https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/wiki/FAQ>
2. `:h macvim-prefs` (in vim)

### set preferences

in general preferences are set by specifying their type and value:

```sh
$ default write org.vim.MacVim MMShowAddTabButton -bool false
```

in most cases, I guess, type can be omitted:

```sh
$ default write org.vim.MacVim MMShowAddTabButton 0
$ default write org.vim.MacVim MMShowAddTabButton false
```

### reset current preferences

```sh
$ defaults delete org.vim.MacVim
```

### show current preferences

```sh
$ defaults read org.vim.MacVim
```
