## [iOS and Android] CLI autolinking

1. <https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md>

> <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/07/03/version-60#native-modules-are-now-autolinked>
>
> The team working on the React Native CLI has introduced major improvements to

> use of react-native link anymore. At the same time, the team overhauled the

=> now there's no need to link libraries manually - it's done automatically when
building application.

for iOS remove all application pods from _ios/Podfile_ (`BVLinearGradient`,
`Picker`, `RNCAsyncStorage`, etc.) and run `pod install` - these RN module pods
must be detected automatically.

however this is not the case with `OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension`
extension - I still had to link it manually in Xcode (select corresponding
target and add _libRCTOneSignal.a_ in `Link Binary With Libraries` section).

not all packages support autolinking - first of all this concerns outdated
packages which haven't been updated for a while. in case of iOS they might have
no podspec => link such packages as usual - using `react-native link`:

```sh
$ react-native link react-native-admob
```

## [Android] AndroidX

so the problem is that application might be using both new AndroidX and old
Android Support libraries which is not allowed.

it's possible to examine all application dependencies using this command:

```sh
$ cd android
$ ./gradlew app:dependencies
```

AFAIU there must be either `com.android.support` or `androidx.*` libraries in
the output but not both.

the reason why AndroidX libraries leak into current application dependencies is
that many RN libraries use the latest versions of Google libraries instead of
specific ones, say (note `+` symbol):

```groovy
// https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/blob/c4c961cf3a76bffe4e9e36cf00201611eecbb898/android/build.gradle

dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '+')}"
    // ...
    implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:${safeExtGet('firebaseVersion', '+')}"
}
```

but the latest versions of Google started to depend on AndroidX libraries since
June 17th, 2019 and it was a breaking change.

there are 2 approaches to solve this problem:

- use Android Support Libraries only
- migrate everything to AndroidX

### use Android Support Libraries only

in most cases it's just necessary to use specific versions of Google libraries
which don't depend AndroidX libraries.

this can be enforced in several ways:

- [RECOMMENDED] try upgrading RN packages

  1. <https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage/issues/128#issuecomment-505423631>

  maintainers of RN packages might have fixed their _build.gradle_ files to use
  specific versions of Google libraries (without AndroidX dependencies):

  ```sh
  $ yarn upgrade --pattern react-native
  ```

  it was the case with `react-native-device-info` package:

  > <https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/693>
  >
  > With the latest firebase/gcm release, the latest version (+) now brings in
  > androidx dependencies. react-native won't be ready for androidx until 0.60
  > so constrain the gcm version to 16.1.0 (the latest pre-androidx version).

  ```diff
    # https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/693/files#diff-7ae5a9093507568eabbf35c3b0665732

    dependencies {
      implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:${safeExtGet('reactNativeVersion', '+')}"
  -   implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '+')}"
  +   implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '16.1.0')}"
  ```

- fork RN packages

  1. <https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/693>

  if RN package is not actively maintained it might take a long time till it's
  fixed, so it makes sense to fork and fix it by yourself (just like it's done
  in the linked PR which is also mentioned previously).

- force use of specific versions of Google libraries

  1. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25292#issuecomment-502998885>
  2. <https://medium.com/@suchydan/how-to-solve-google-play-services-version-collision-in-gradle-dependencies-ef086ae5c75f>
  3. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25307#issuecomment-503516458>
  4. <https://medium.com/mindorks/avoiding-conflicts-in-android-gradle-dependencies-28e4200ca235>

  in this solution it's not necessary to modify Google libraries but your own
  _android/app/build.gradle_ file only.

  perform these steps for each RN package which depends on AndroidX libraries
  until there are no AndroidX dependencies (run `gradlew app:dependencies` to
  find such RN packages as described above):

  - find Google libraries in RN package dependencies

    libraries inside `com.google.android.gms` and `com.google.firebase` groups
    are affected:

    ```groovy
    // https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification/blob/c4c961cf3a76bffe4e9e36cf00201611eecbb898/android/build.gradle

    dependencies {
        // ...
        implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:${safeExtGet('googlePlayServicesVersion', '+')}"
        // ...
        implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:${safeExtGet('firebaseVersion', '+')}"
    }
    ```

  - exclude those libraries from RN package dependencies in your application

    ```diff
      // android/app/build.gradle

      dependencies {
    -     implementation project(':react-native-push-notification')
    +     implementation(project(':react-native-push-notification')) {
    +       exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-gcm'
    +       exclude group: 'com.google.firebase', module: 'firebase-messaging'
    +     }
    ```

  - use specific versions of those libraries in your application

    ```diff
      // android/app/build.gradle

      dependencies {
          // ...
    +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:16.1.0") {
    +       force = true;
    +     }
    +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:16.2.0") {
    +       force = true;
    +     }
    +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-gcm:16.1.0") {
    +       force = true;
    +     }
    +     implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-stats:16.0.1") {
    +       force = true;
    +     }
    +     implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:18.0.0") {
    +       force = true;
    +     }
    +     implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-iid:18.0.0") {
    +       force = true;
    +     }
      }
    ```

    a rule of thumb is not to use June versions, the last but one versions will
    do in most cases.

    see [Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) for the list of library
    versions and corresponding release dates.

    it might be necessary to force versions of both direct and transitive RN
    package dependencies (just like in example above) - inspect the output of
    `gradlew app:dependencies` command after adding all direct dependencies.

### migrate everything to AndroidX

1. <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/07/03/version-60#androidx-support>
2. <https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/blob/master/docs/AndroidXMigration.md>

- Multidex support

  1. <https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex#mdex-pre-l>

  ```diff
    // android/app/build.gradle

      dependencies {
          // ...
    -     implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'
    +
    +     def multidex_version = "2.0.1"
    +     implementation 'androidx.multidex:multidex:$multidex_version'
  ```

- Jetifier

  Jetifier is running automatically:

  ```
  $ react-native run-android
  ...
  info Running jetifier to migrate libraries to AndroidX. You can disable it using "--no-jetifier" flag.
  Jetifier found 1220 file(s) to forward-jetify. Using 4 workers...
