installation
------------

```sh
$ brew install ansible
```

usually Python is installed on remote node via task but it can be installed
manually as well - say, to be able to run ad-hoc commands:

```sh
$ ssh sithex
# apt install python
```

configuration
-------------

### SSH config entry

add SSH config entry for remote node:

```sshconfig
# .ssh/config

Host sithex
 User sithex
 Hostname DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 ForwardAgent yes
```

### SSH user

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/intro_configuration.html#remote-user>

> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/36677811>
>
> Besides, ansible_user is used when we want to specifiy default SSH user in
> ansible hosts file where as remote_user is used in playbook context.

by default user from corresponding entry in SSH config is used but it might
be app user (like in SSH config entry above) so it's better to specify SSH
user to run Ansible as explicitly:

```cfg
# ansible.cfg

[defaults]

# formerly known as `user`
remote_user = root
```

now it's necessary to copy your SSH public key to remote node (unless
it's already done - say, in DigitalOcean Control Panel):

```sh
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@sithex
/ enter root password
$ ssh root@sithex
```

NOTE: it's considered to be not very secure to permit root login via SSH.

### inventory file

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-03>
>
> Hosts in inventory can be grouped arbitrarily. For instance, you could
> have a debian group, a web-servers group, a production group, etc...

```yaml
[web]
sithex
```

`[web]` here is a group name (optional).

running
-------

### ad-hoc commands

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/intro_adhoc.html>

ad-hoc commands can be useful for testing purposes to make sure everything
is configured correctly.

ping all nodes:

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-02>
>
> `all` is a shortcut meaning 'all hosts found in inventory file'.

```
$ ansible all -m ping
sithex | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

execute shell command on specific node:

```
$ ansible sithex -m shell -a 'date'
sithex | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
Mon Jun 18 22:58:35 UTC 2018
```

### running master playbook

```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/prod/hosts -l sithex -v site.yml
```

see `environments` and `multiple applications` sections for description
of specified `ansible-playbook` options.

notes
-----

### playbooks

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html>

it's better to store playbooks in Ansible project root directory (this is
what recommended in Best Practices) since roles imported inside playbooks
are searched for relative to current directory - and they are not found by
their name if playbooks are stored in _playbooks/_ directory.

### roles

roles are executed once within one play only (where hosts are specified) -
not across all plays and playbooks in Ansible project:

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html>
>
> Ansible will only allow a role to execute once, even if defined multiple times,
> if the parameters defined on the role are not different for each definition.

#### role dependencies

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies>
>
> Role dependencies must use the classic role definition style.

```yaml
# roles/sithexapp/meta/main.yml

dependencies:
  - role: elixir
```

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html>
>
> Role dependencies are always executed before the role that includes them, and
> may be recursive. Dependencies also follow the duplication rules specified above.

#### role dependencies vs. `import_role` (or `include_role`)

1. <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23733>

it looks like they serve the same purpose - to execute a role passing
parameters when required:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# roles/sithexapp/meta/main.yml
# role dependency

dependencies:
  - role: elixir
    app_name: "{{ sithexapp_app_name }}"
    app_user: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"

# roles/sithexapp/tasks/main.yml
# import_role

- import_role: name=elixirapp
  vars:
    app_name: "{{ sithexapp_app_name }}"
    app_user: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"
```
{% endraw %}

the only difference I see is that role dependencies are always executed
before the role that includes them while `import_role` can be inserted
anywhere among other role tasks.

in both cases roles follow duplication rules (see `roles` section above).

currently I use role dependecies to install system dependencies (like
install Elixir itself) and `import_role` - to configure application
(like create users, directories, etc.).

***UPDATE***

it's easier to always use `import_role` so that all included roles are
listed in one file (_roles/my_app/tasks/main.yml_).

#### `include_role` vs. `import_role`

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html>
>
> When roles are defined in the classic manner, they are treated as static
> imports and processed during playbook parsing.

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_includes.html#includes-vs-imports>
>
> - All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
> - All include* statements are processed as they encountered during the execution
>   of the playbook.

I still can't understand the difference between these directives and use
`import_role` one because it seems to be more strict.

#### role parameters

1. <https://serverfault.com/a/758391>

when I import another role I define its parameters in _vars/_ directory
(in a separate file named after imported role) - instead of passing these
parameters to the role directly in `vars` section.

so now role parameters are not available to imported role only - they just
happen to be used in that role only because of role prefix. and on another
side imported role verifies required variables are defined.

### tasks

#### `pre_tasks` section

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/playbooks_keywords.html#play>
>
> pre_tasks
>   A list of tasks to execute before roles.

> <https://github.com/Mohitsharma44/ansible-playbooks/wiki/vars-pre-post-and-handlers#pre_tasks-and-post_tasks>
>
> A general use case for pre_task could be when you need to make sure that your
> system package manager's cache is updated.

### variables

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html>

variables are always referenced using `{{ var }}` syntax of Jinja2 templating
system - even if they are not interpolated inside another string:

```yaml
- name: Create secrets file
  copy:
    src: "{{ env }}.secret.exs"
    dest: "/var/{{ env }}.secret"
    owner: sithex
    group: sithex
    mode: 0660
```

passed variables propagate to all included roles: say, role A → role B → role C.
if role A passes `foo` variable to role B, this variable is available in role C
too without passing it to role C explicitly - it's true for both `include_role`
and `import_role` modules.

read more about flat namespace in `style guide` section (the rule about using
role prefix for all variables).

#### `vars` section

> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/42109037>
>
> Role variables defined in `vars` have a very high precedence - they can only
> be overwritten by passing them on the command line, in the specific task or in
> a block. Therefore, almost all your variables should be defined in `defaults`.

#### `vars` directory

> <https://codereviewvideos.com/course/ansible-tutorial/video/variable-precedence-where-to-put-your-role-vars>
>
> I use `vars` directory for system specific variables.
>
> Everything else - all standard, shared variables we would need and anything
> we want the user of our Role to override should go in `defaults/main.yml`.

=> use _vars/_ directory for all app role variables which are not meant to be
configured from outside and for role parameters (see above).

### templates

{% raw %}
for some reason both `{% if ... %}` and `{% endif %}` statements indent the
next line - use `{% if ... -%}` to disable indentation of the first line of
the block and `{%- endif %}` with empty line to disable indentation of the
first line after the block (it's kind of a hack: `{%- endif %}` effectively
removes the next empty line by removing newline at the end of current line):
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
```conf
# roles/nginx/templates/app_site.j2

server {
  # ...

  {% if use_ssl -%}
  ssl_certificate {{ ssl_certificate }};
  ssl_certificate_key {{ ssl_certificate_key }};

  ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  ssl_ciphers "RC4:HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!kEDH";
  {%- endif %}

}
```
{% endraw %}

### file and template paths

NOTE: template paths would use _templates/_ directory instead -
      all the rules below still apply.

file paths can be specified relative to:

- _files/_ directory (inside current role)

  {% raw %}
  ```yaml
  # roles/sithexapp/tasks/secrets.yml

  - name: Create secrets file
    copy:
      # => roles/sithexapp/files/prod.secret.exs
      src: "{{ env }}.secret.exs"
      dest: "/var/{{ env }}.secret.exs"
      owner: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"
      group: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"
      mode: 0660
  ```
  {% endraw %}

- Ansible project root

  {% raw %}
  ```yaml
  # roles/sithexapp/tasks/secrets.yml

  - name: Create secrets file
    copy:
      # => roles/sithexapp/files/prod.secret.exs
      src: "roles/sithexapp/files/{{ env }}.secret.exs"
      dest: "/var/{{ env }}.secret.exs"
      owner: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"
      group: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"
      mode: 0660
  ```
  {% endraw %}

  this path can be passed as an argument to another role:

  {% raw %}
  ```yaml
  # roles/sithexapp/tasks/main.yml

  - include_role: name=elixirapp
    vars:
      app_name: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"
      app_user: "{{ sithexapp_app_user }}"
      secrets_path: "roles/sithexapp/files/{{ env }}.secret.exs"
  ```
  {% endraw %}

#### trailing slashes

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/modules/copy_module.html>

file and template paths should never end with `/` in variables - add
trailing slash in task arguments only (so that it's easy to say if
task argument has trailing slash or not without looking up variable
definition).

```yaml
# roles/lainapp/vars/elixirapp.yml

elixirapp_secrets_dir: "roles/lainapp/files/config"
```

```yaml
# roles/elixirapp/tasks/secrets.yml

- name: Upload secret files
  copy:
    src: "{{ elixirapp_secrets_dir }}"
    dest: "/var/{{ elixirapp_app_name }}"
```

### handlers

1. <http://codeheaven.io/15-things-you-should-know-about-ansible/#handlers-are-special-types-of-tasks>

in some guides use of handlers is discouraged but still they can be useful in
that they are not run if the task that triggers them hasn't changed the state.

style guide
-----------

1. <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenOPS/pages/26837527/Ansible+Code+Conventions>

### don't extract variables into _vars/*.yml_ files unless necessary

it's necessary if these variables are used/included in many places or they
contain lots of data which might be hard to inline (say, SSH keys).

don't extract, say, packages to install or directories to create which are
used in one task only:

{% raw %}
```diff
  # roles/common/tasks/packages.yml

  - include_vars: file=packages.yml

  - name: Install common packages
    apt:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      update_cache: yes
      cache_valid_time: 3600
      state: present
-   loop: "{{ common_packages }}"
+   loop:
+     - git
+     - htop
+     - mc
+     - ccze
```
{% endraw %}

### update package index implicitly with caching

1. <https://github.com/LunarLogic/ansible-elixir-playbooks/blob/master/roles/install_postgresql/0.0.1/tasks/main.yml>

NOTE: package index is known as `apt cache` in Ansible docs:

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/apt_module.html>
>
> cache_valid_time
>   Update the apt cache if its older than the cache_valid_time.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# roles/common/tasks/packages.yml

# update explicitly
- name: Update package index
  apt:
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
    cache_valid_time: 3600

# [RECOMMENDED] update implicitly
- name: Install common packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
    cache_valid_time: 3600
  loop: "{{ packages }}"
```
{% endraw %}

### never pass `env` variable to roles and templates explicitly

treat it like a global variable which is available everywhere and
don't check it's defined before role execution - assume it always is.

### use role prefix for all variables inside the role

1. <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/12373>
2. <https://www.reddit.com/r/ansible/comments/7dd56v/flat_namespace_why>

> <https://blog.opsfactory.rocks/ansible-roles-and-default-variables-9bcd379bae3f>
>
> When writing your default variables, namespace them. Ansible’s
> memory model for variables is essentially flat and global.

prefix all role variables (both passed to the role from outside and defined
inside _vars/*.yml_ files) with a role name and use single underscore as a
delimiter (in this case it's preferable to have terse role names consisting
of one word if possible):

{% raw %}
```yaml
# roles/postgresql/vars/databases.yml

postgresql_databases:
  - name: "{{ postgresql_app_name }}_{{ env }}"
```

alternatively use double underscore as a delimiter (say, when role names
contain underscores themselves):

{% raw %}
```yaml
# roles/postgresql/vars/databases.yml

postgresql__databases:
  - name: "{{ postgresql__app_name }}_{{ env }}"
```

=> anyway ALL variables inside any given role MUST have a role prefix!

the only exception is `env` variable which I've decided to make available
globally (see the previous rule).

NOTE: using role-prefixed variables allows to avoid recursive loop error
      (see `troubleshooting` section).

### always pass local variables to templates

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/38653180/3632318>

just like when rendering partials in Rails: pass all local variables
explicitly and don't reference global variables inside partials (even
though they will be available there) - except for `env` variable (see
the previous rule).

`vars` section is used to pass local variables to the template:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# roles/sithexapp/tasks/foo.yml

- template:
    src: "foo_{{ env }}.conf"
    dest: "/etc/foo_{{ env }}.conf"
    vars:
      app_name: "{{ sithexapp_app_name }}"
```
{% endraw %}

don't use role-prefixed variables inside the template: local variables
must be passed to the template without a role prefix - I hope these
variables stay local to the template and cannot sneak into other roles
potentially causing mayhem there.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# roles/nginx/tasks/configure.yml

- name: Create app site
  template:
    src: app_site.j2
    dest: "/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ nginx_app_site }}"
    # ...
  vars:
    # role-prefixed variables must be referenced through local variables
    app_site: "{{ nginx_app_site }}"
    # local variables cannot have a role prefix
    ssl_certificate: "{{ nginx_ssl_dir }}/{{ nginx_app_name }}.pem"
    ssl_certificate_key: "{{ nginx_ssl_dir }}/{{ nginx_app_name }}.key"
    # ...
```
{% endraw %}

NOTE: passing through variables to templates might lead to recursive
      loop - just like when passing through variables to included roles
      (see `troubleshooting` section below).

### don't use shorthand syntax for `include_vars` module

in general always use parameter names to avoid ambiguity:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# bad
- include_vars: dirs.yml

# good
- include_vars:
    file: dirs.yml

# also good
- include_vars: file=dirs.yml
```
{% endraw %}

### don't use Jinja2 templating delimiters in when statements

1. <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/22397>

{% raw %}
```yaml
# bad
- name: Upload SSL files
  copy:
    src: "{{ ssl_dir }}/"
    dest: "{{ env_dir }}/nginx/ssl"
  when: "{{ use_ssl }}"

# good
- name: Upload SSL files
  copy:
    src: "{{ ssl_dir }}/"
    dest: "{{ env_dir }}/nginx/ssl"
  when: use_ssl
```
{% endraw %}

### declare required and optional role parameters

1. <https://github.com/cycloidio/ansible-backup/blob/master/defaults/main.yml>

both required and optional role paramaters are declared in _defaults/main.yml_.

#### required parameters

required parameters are checked they're defined right before role execution:

> <https://coderleaf.wordpress.com/2017/07/06/ansible-check-for-required-variables-before-role-execution/>
>
> Ansible does not provide a standard way to check that required variables
> are defined before executing a tsak.
>
> Ansible, relies instead on the standard mechanism of a task failing if a
> variable being used has not been defined.
>
> Sometimes you want to make sure that all required variables are defined
> before starting the tasks for a role.

```yaml
# roles/elixirapp/defaults/main.yml

elixirapp_required_vars:
  - elixirapp_app_name
  - elixirapp_app_user
  - elixirapp_secrets_dir
  - elixirapp_nginx
```

{% raw %}
```yaml
# roles/elixirapp/tasks/main.yml

- name: Check required vars
  fail: msg="Variable '{{ item }}' is not defined"
  when: item not in vars
  loop: "{{ elixirapp_required_vars }}"

# other tasks...
```
{% endraw %}

#### optional parameters

- with default values

  optional parameters have default values so they are the very `role defaults`
  and are meant to be overridden by definition:

  > <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html>
  >
  > Basically, anything that goes into “role defaults” (the defaults folder
  > inside the role) is the most malleable and easily overridden. Anything
  > in the vars directory of the role overrides previous versions of that
  > variable in namespace.

  ```yaml
  # roles/nginx/defaults/main.yml

  nginx_required_vars:
    - nginx_domain
    # more required vars

  nginx_port: 4000
  ```

  note that default value will be used only if optional variable is not passed
  at all. if variable is passed, its value will be used instead of default one
  - even if it's `null` or `undefined`.

- without default values

  alternatively, to make a variable optional, it's possible just to exclude it
  from `*_required_vars` - without specifying any default value altogether:

  ```yaml
  # roles/elixirapp/defaults/main.yml

  elixirapp_required_vars:
    - elixirapp_app_name
    # more required vars

  elixirapp_optional_vars:
    - elixirapp_backup
  ```

  NOTE: `elixirapp_optional_vars` list is used for documentation purposes only -
        to outline role's interface.

  in this case it will be necessary to check whether this variable is defined
  or not somewhere in the role:

  ```yaml
  - import_role: name=backup
    when: elixirapp_backup is defined
  ```

IMO it's better not to mix optional parameters with and without default values
=> don't add optional parameters with default values to `*_optional_vars`:

```yaml
# roles/elixirapp/defaults/main.yml

elixirapp_required_vars:
  - elixirapp_app_name
  - elixirapp_app_user

elixirapp_optional_vars:
  - elixirapp_backup

elixirapp_ssh:
  keys: |-
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...
```

### don't use tests as filters

```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/prod/hosts -v site.yml
...
[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Using tests as filters is deprecated. Instead of using
`result|failed` use `result is failed`. This feature will be removed in version
2.9. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting deprecation_warnings=False
in ansible.cfg.
```

### use ansible-vault to encrypt sensitive information

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vault.html>
2. <http://codeheaven.io/15-things-you-should-know-about-ansible#use-ansible-vault-when-you-want-to-store-sensitive-information>

NOTE: vaulted files and variables will be decrypted on the fly using supplied
      vault password when playbook is run.

#### configuration

```diff
  # ansible.cfg

  [defaults]

  remote_user = root
+ vault_password_file = .vault_pass.txt
```

```diff
  # .gitignore

  *.retry
+ .vault_pass.txt
```

_.vault_pass.txt_:

```txt
<MY_VAULT_PASSWORD>
```

#### encrypt the whole file (create vaulted file)

```sh
$ ansible-vault encrypt roles/sithexapp/files/prod.secret.exs
```

decrypt the whole file:

```sh
$ ansible-vault decrypt roles/sithexapp/files/prod.secret.exs
```

edit decrypted file:

```sh
$ EDITOR=vim ansible-vault edit roles/sithexapp/files/prod.secret.exs
```

view decrypted file:

```sh
$ PAGER=less ansible-vault view roles/sithexapp/files/prod.secret.exs
```

#### encrypt single variable (create vaulted variable)

```sh
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
!vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          62383638653063373733343561376337623736343737393366353864623866613039383430393563

```

encrypted string is now ready to be included in a YAML file:

```yaml

environments
------------

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#alternative-directory-layout>
2. <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-multistage-environments-with-ansible#using-ansible-constructs-that-allow-explicit-loading-order>

```yaml
# inventories/prod/group_vars/all
# inventories/prod/host_vars/all

env: prod
```

```yaml
# inventories/stage/group_vars/all
# inventories/stage/host_vars/all

env: stage
```

most likely it's not necessary to specify environment in _host\_vars/all_
files (and create them too) since `all` group contains every host.

now `env` variable is available in all plays and roles when inventory file
from corresponding directory is used:

```ini
# inventories/prod/hosts
# inventories/stage/hosts

sithex

[webservers]

[dbservers]
```

```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/prod/hosts -v site.yml
```

multiple applications
---------------------

there're at least 2 way to run master playbook against selected
host (and application as a result):

- *[RECOMMENDED]* use `-l`/`--limit` option to select application host

  add hosts to environment-specific inventory files:

  ```ini
  # inventories/prod/hosts
  # inventories/stage/hosts

  lain
  sithex
  ```

  add plays to master playbook:

  ```yaml
  # site.yml

  - hosts: lain
    tasks:
      - import_role: name=lainapp

  - hosts: sithex
    tasks:
      - import_role: name=sithexapp
  ```

  run master playbook against selected host with `-l`/`--limit` option:

  ```sh
  $ ansible-playbook -i inventories/prod/hosts -l lain -v site.yml
  ```

- create a separate inventory file for each application

  these files are created in application subdirectories of _inventories/_
  directory - each inventory file contains a single application host only
  (as a rule - application can be deployed to multiple hosts of course):

  ```ini
  # inventories/lain/prod/hosts
  # inventories/lain/stage/hosts

  lain
  ```

  ```ini
  # inventories/sithex/prod/hosts
  # inventories/sithex/stage/hosts

  sithex
  ```

  master playbook remains the same:

  ```yaml
  # site.yml

  - hosts: lain
    tasks:
      - import_role: name=lainapp

  - hosts: sithex
    tasks:
      - import_role: name=sithexapp
  ```

  run master playbook using application-specific inventory file:

  ```sh
  $ ansible-playbook -i inventories/lain/prod/hosts -v site.yml
  ```

troubleshooting
---------------

### recursive loop detected in template string

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/21738751>

passing through variables to included roles might lead to recursive loop
inside the template:

```yaml
- template:
    # ...
  vars:
    app_name: "{{ app_name }}"
    app_user: "{{ app_user }}"
```

{% raw %}
```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/prod/hosts -v site.yml
...
recursive loop detected in template string: {{ app_user }}
```
{% endraw %}

**solution**

1. <https://coderleaf.wordpress.com/2017/07/06/ansible-check-for-required-variables-before-role-execution/>

there at least 2 ways to solve this problem:

- don't pass through variables to roles and templates and use all currently
  defined variables in included roles and templates without all the hassle
  of passing them explicitly

  if role A includes role B, all variables included in role A become
  available to role B.

  a major drawback of this solution is that you are not explicit about role
  parameters and you never know right away what your role parameters are.

- use unique namespace (usually a role prefix) for all variables to avoid
  name clashes and recursive loop errors as a result

  this is a recommended approach now (see `style guide` section).

### variable can't be resolved when passed between more than 3 roles

role A → role B → role C → role D (→ means `imports`) and variable `foo` is
passed between roles with corresponding role prefixes: `a_foo` → `b_foo` →
`c_foo` → `d_foo`. in the end `d_foo` should reference `a_foo` variable via
all intermediate variables but `a_foo` turns out to be not defined in role D
(`vars` variable doesn't contain it while it contains `b_foo` and `c_foo`):

```
d_foo = c_foo
c_foo = b_foo
b_foo = a_foo
a_foo = undefined
```

**solution**

TODO: still not resolved.

my temporary solution is to shorten this chain of role imports by turning
role D into a separate task inside role C.

### Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages

```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventories/prod/hosts -l eva -v site.yml
TASK [elixir : Install Erlang] *****************************************************************
fatal: [eva]: FAILED! => {... E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. ...}
```

**solution**

try to bump Erlang version to be installed - most likely it's outdated or
cannot be installed due to broken dependencies (in my case it was listed
in output of `apt-cache policy erlang` command but still caused the error
above - using the latest version helped to fix the problem).
