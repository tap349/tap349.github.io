<hr>

before the lesson:

- print some text for each of 14 students (for them to read it and translate)
- print rationale from here

in the lesson:

- ask everyone to read and translate part of the book (using printed sheets of
  paper)
- lesson vocabulary (or it can be populated dynamically during the lesson)
- (?) download the first 2 lectures and listen to them in class
- ask questions about the things they might know (say, static vs. dynamic
  typing, examples of programming languages)

HW:

- translate from English to Russian and back (several variants or even
  individual tasks?)
- learn current lesson's vocabulary - I will ask translations in the next lesson
- watch the 1st youtube video lecture 1.1 - I will ask how you understand
  certain episodes in the next lesson
- translate parts of book (say, the 1st chapter) - individual paragraphs for
  each student
- (?) challenge for chapters 1 and 2

TODO:

- composition is associative (read about it somewhere else)
- complete highlighting Chapter 2 (Types and Functions)
- watch lecture 1.1 till end (and lecture 1.2 if you have time)
- separate Haskell lesson?

## RATIONALE

Also I'd like to clarify that I am neither professional teacher or professional
scientist - I am a professional software developer. That is I earn my living by
writing programs in different programming languages. That is why that is why you
might know many things better than me because I studied them many years ago
while you are studying right now. What I’m going to talk about with you may be
not mathematically strict so pardon for sloppiness. Probably the one thing I
know better than most of you is English. Though it’s also not perfect either of
course )

IDK whether you are familiar with reading technical literature in English but
IMO it's quite straightforward compared to reading fiction: vocabulary is quite
limited and you will learn most of it after reading, say, the first 50 pages.
This book is no exception. I encourage you to read it by yourself and ask
questions if you have a hard time understanding anything from the book.

The last but the least as the proverb goes - about my motivation. I must have
the one too. Of course the money I get by giving this course of lectures is no
motivation - I guess you understand it. First of all I'm interested and highly
motivated to learn the basics of category theory by myself - even though I
encounter its concepts quite often I have never found time to study the theory
behind them. This is the very lack of time I was talking about. You know how it
happens - you always have a long list of books (TODO list) of books to read. In
you next life ) Because in current life you are too busy making other more
important things. So I want to solidify my knowledge of this topic by myself
because the best way to learn anything is to try to explain it to someone else -
to you in this case :)

## STRUCTURE OF THE COURSE

This course will be based on the book and video lectures by Bartosz Milewski. As
you might guess he is some Polish guy judging by his surname. He got his PhD in
Theoretical Physics in Poland. He worked in Microsoft, then founded his own
company, wrote a book "C++ in Action". His interest in C++ template
metaprogramming and concurrency naturally led him to Haskell and then to
category theory. His series of blog posts was converted to the book "Category
Theory for Programmers" which became quite popular. This book is a topic of our
course. This book is accompanied by video lectures on YouTube which we'll also
be using.

Our goal is study the 1st part of the book - it's a challenging task but we
have approximately 10 classes in this semester so we have all chances to do it.

Finally this book has a lot of examples in Haskell. It's HIGHLY likely that you
don't Haskell - just like me. But still it's quite popular languages among
certain groups of people. So we're going to take time to learn its basics. Some
concepts will be introduced as we study the book. Maybe we'll dedicate a whole
lesson to learning its syntax and basic constructs.
