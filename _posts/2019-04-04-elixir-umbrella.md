### you can't configure umbrella application

that is you cannot add any options to umbrella application configuration:

```elixir
# config/config.exs

config :umbrella_app, foo: 123
```

or else you'll get this warning when compiling the project:

```
You have configured application :umbrella_app in your configuration file,
but the application is not available.

This usually means one of:

  1. You have not added the application as a dependency in a mix.exs file.

  2. You are configuring an application that does not really exist.

Please ensure :alice exists or remove the configuration.
```

I guess this is because umbrella application is just a container of other
applications but not a proper application itself - it has no `app` key in
its project configuration unlike child applications (`project/0` function
inside _mix.exs_).

tips
----

### add version to umbrella project configuration

it's not added by default since umbrella application is not a normal Elixir
application (as discussed above):

```elixir
# mix.exs

def project do
  [
    version: "0.1.0",
    # ...
  ]
end
```

still once added it can be used in AppSignal, Distillery and Bootleg configs
(which is very handy):

```elixir
# config/appsignal.exs

config :appsignal, :config,
  active: true,
  name: "UmbrellaApp",
  revision: Mix.Project.config()[:version],
  # ...
```

```elixir
# rel/config.exs

release :umbrella_app do
  set(version: Mix.Project.config()[:version])
  # ...
end
```

```elixir
# config/deploy.exs

config :app, :alice
config :version, Mix.Project.config()[:version]
# ...
```

still it makes sense to bump versions of child applications as usual to
communicate changes to them with semantic versioning (especially if you
have changelogs). if version of child application is incremented version
of umbrella application should be incremented as well but not vice versa.

configuration
-------------

### AppSignal

1. <https://docs.appsignal.com/elixir/installation.html#installing-the-package>

deployment
----------

### Distillery

1. <https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/introduction/umbrella_projects.html>

> <https://hackernoon.com/mastering-elixir-releases-with-distillery-a-pretty-complete-guide-497546f298bc#4eae>

> 1. Include the names of your child applications in the applications list
> of the Release configuration.
>
> 2. You can choose to take the Release version number from any of the child
> applications by using current_version(:my_child_app).
>
> As mentioned before, itâ€™s also possible to define more than one Release in
> your rel/config.exs and thus specify multiple Release profiles. This can be
> useful if you want to have Releases that only include certain child
> applications from your umbrella project.

### Bootleg

it's necessary to set version manually when deploying umbrella application -
it can be fetched from umbrella project configuration (see the tip above):

```elixir
# config/deploy.exs

config :app, :alice
config :version, Mix.Project.config()[:version]
```

or else you'll get this error:

```
$ mix bootleg.build
** (RuntimeError) Error: app or version to deploy is not set.
Usually these are automatically picked up from Mix.Project.
If this is an umbrella app, you must set these in your deploy.exs, e.g.:
# config(:app, :myapp)
# config(:version, "0.0.1")
    deps/bootleg/lib/bootleg/tasks/build.exs:6: Bootleg.DynamicTasks.VerifyConfig.execute/0
    ...
```

troubleshooting
---------------

### file navigation doesn't work in vim

that is you cannot "goto file" with `gf` command and cannot jump to alternate
file when using `vim-projectionist` plugin (or the like).

**solution**

change CWD to directory of child application - for example, use `cd` mapping
from inside NERDTree window.
