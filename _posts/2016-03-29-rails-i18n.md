configuration of rails app to support I18n.

## routes

### active admin

AA controllers are not inherited from application controller
and consequently don't use _default_url_options_ defined there.

that is why url helpers in AA don't generate correct urls
(using the first argument to url helper as `locale` parameter value).

simple solution is to exclude AA routes from `locale` scope in _routes.rb_:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  scope '(:locale)', locale: /en/ do
  end

  ActiveAdmin.routes(self)
end
```

## rspec

locale is not set from `config.i18n.default_locale` in _application.rb_
(defaults to `:en`) and thusly has to be set manually in each spec:

```ruby
before { I18n.locale = :ru }
```

or else set it globally in _spec/rails_helper.rb_ or _spec/support/factory_girl.rb_
(or just create a separate file like _spec/support/i18n.rb_):

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before :suite do
    I18n.locale = :ru
  end
end
```

also it's possible to set it to default locale
(rspec for some reason doesn't set locale to default locale):

```ruby
I18n.locale = I18n.default_locale
```

NOTE: translations from class methods are loaded before `before` block!

## mailers

_application.rb_:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = {
  host: Pumba::DOMAIN, only_path: false, locale: I18n.locale
}
```
