troubleshooting
---------------

### build is not starting after changes are pushed to Github

**solution**

there was an error in my CircleCI config - `version: 2` key was missing in
`workflows` section.

I have found this error by clicking project name (or else it's possible to
click any branch of the project):

| CircleCI: `BUILDS` (left menu) → `<project_name>` (link)

you'll see a big yellow `NEEDS SETUP` button if there are any config errors.

### /bin/bash: yarn: command not found

**solution**

pre-built CircleCI Docker image `circleci/ruby:2.5.1` doesn't have
Yarn preinstalled - use `-node` image variant instead:

> <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/yarn/#using-yarn-in-circleci>
>
> If you are using one of the other language images such as circleci/python
> or circleci/ruby, there are two image variants that will include Yarn as
> well as NodeJS. These would be the -node and -node-browsers image variants.

### Rails.application.credentials are empty in Rails 5.2+

**solution**

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48935168/handle-credentials-in-circleci-rails-app>

Rails 5.2 uses encrypted _config/credentials.yml.enc_ to store credentials and
_config/master.key_ to decrypt it but the latter is not available on CircleCI.

it's possible to store master key in `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable:

> <http://guides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html#encrypted-secrets>
>
> Secrets will be decrypted in production, using a key stored either in the
> RAILS_MASTER_KEY environment variable, or in a key file.

| CircleCI: Project Settings → `BUILD SETTINGS` (section) → `Environment Variables`

### deploy job prompts for deploy user password

**solution**

1. <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#add_ssh_keys>
2. <https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015628247-Are-you-sure-you-want-to-continue-connecting-yes-no->

I haven't added my private SSH key:

| CircleCI: Project Settings → `PERMISSIONS` (section) → `SSH permissions`
| `Add SSH key` (button)

- `Hostname` (input): server IP from _config/deploy/production.rb_
- `Private Key` (textarea): contents of your _~/.ssh/id_rsa_

after SSH key is added, you'll see its fingerprint - use it to add SSH key
in `add_ssh_keys` step of `deploy` job in CircleCI config:

```diff
  # _.circleci/config.yml_

  jobs:
    deploy:
      steps:
        - checkout
+       - add_ssh_keys:
+           fingerprints:
+             - '21:cd:07:a3:b8:b9:1f:20:b0:eb:59:c7:e3:14:fc:5e'
```

NOTE: it's possible not to specify which SSH keys to use (via fingerprints)
      explicitly in CircleCI config - by default all added SSH keys will be
      loaded:

> <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#add_ssh_keys>
>
> Note that CircleCI 2.0 jobs are auto configured with ssh-agent with all keys
> auto-loaded, and is sufficient for most cases. add_ssh_keys may be needed to
> have greater control over which SSH keys to authenticate
