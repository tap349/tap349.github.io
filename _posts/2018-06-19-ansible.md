installation
------------

```sh
$ brew install ansible
```

add SSH config entry for remote node:

```sshconfig
# .ssh/config

Host sithex
 User root
 Hostname DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 ForwardAgent yes
```

install Python on remote node:

```sh
$ ssh sithex
# apt install python
```

configuration
-------------

create inventory file:

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-03>
>
> Hosts in inventory can be grouped arbitrarily. For instance, you could
> have a debian group, a web-servers group, a production group, etc...

```yaml
[web]
sithex
```

`[web]` here is a group name (optional).

now ping all nodes:

> <https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto/tree/master/step-02>
>
> `all` is a shortcut meaning 'all hosts found in inventory file'.

```
$ ansible all -m ping
sithex | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

execute shell command on specific node:

```
$ ansible sithex -m shell -a 'date'
sithex | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
Mon Jun 18 22:58:35 UTC 2018
```

### roles

roles are executed once within one play only (where hosts are specified) -
not across all plays and playbooks in Ansible project:

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html>
>
> Role dependencies are always executed before the role that includes them, and
> may be recursive. Dependencies also follow the duplication rules specified above.

#### role dependencies

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-dependencies>
>
> Role dependencies must use the classic role definition style.

```yaml
# roles/sithex_app/meta/main.yml

dependencies:
  - role: elixir
```

#### role dependencies vs. include_role

1. <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23733>

it looks like they serve the same purpose - to execute a role passing
parameters when required:

```yaml
# roles/sithex_app/meta/main.yml
# role dependency

dependencies:
  - role: elixir
    app_name: "{{ app['name'] }}"
    app_user: "{{ app['user'] }}"

# roles/sithex_app/tasks/main.yml
# include_role

- include_role: name=elixir_app
  vars:
    app_name: "{{ app['name'] }}"
    app_user: "{{ app['user'] }}"
```

the only difference I see is that role dependencies are always executed
before the role that includes them while `include_role` directive can be
inserted anywhere among other role tasks.

currently I use role dependecies to install system dependencies (like
install Elixir itself) and `include_role` - to configure application
(like create users, directories, etc.).

### tasks

#### `pre_tasks` section

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/playbooks_keywords.html#play>
>
> pre_tasks
>   A list of tasks to execute before roles.

> <https://github.com/Mohitsharma44/ansible-playbooks/wiki/vars-pre-post-and-handlers#pre_tasks-and-post_tasks>
>
> A general use case for pre_task could be when you need to make sure that your
> system package manager's cache is updated.

### variables

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html>

variables are always referenced using `{{ var }}` syntax of Jinja2 templating
system - even if they are not interpolated inside another string:

```yaml
- name: Create secrets file
  copy:
    src: "{{ env }}.secret.exs"
    dest: "/var/{{ env }}.secret"
    owner: sithex
    group: sithex
    mode: 0660
```

#### `vars` section

> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/42109037>
>
> Role variables defined in `vars` have a very high precedence - they can only
> be overwritten by passing them on the command line, in the specific task or in
> a block. Therefore, almost all your variables should be defined in `defaults`.

> <https://codereviewvideos.com/course/ansible-tutorial/video/variable-precedence-where-to-put-your-role-vars>
>
> I use `vars` directory for system specific variables.
>
> Everything else - all standard, shared variables we would need and anything
> we want the user of our Role to override should go in `defaults/main.yml`.

=> use _vars/_ directory for almost all app role variables (since they are not
meant to be configured from outside).

### SSH user

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/intro_configuration.html#remote-user>

> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/36677811>
>
> Besides, ansible_user is used when we want to specifiy default SSH user in
> ansible hosts file where as remote_user is used in playbook context.

by default user from corresponding entry in SSH config is used but it might
be app user so it's better to specify SSH user to run Ansible as explicitly:

```cfg
# ansible.cfg

[defaults]

# formerly known as `user`
remote_user = root
```

tips

### common roles directory for Ansible projects

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-search-path>
>
> In Ansible 1.4 and later you can configure an additional roles_path to
> search for roles. Use this to check all of your common roles out to one
> location, and share them easily between multiple playbook projects.

### *[OPTIONAL]* don't use common app variables

common app variables are stored in _vars/main.yml_ (this file becomes
obsolete if these variables are no longer used):

```yaml
# roles/sithex_app/vars/main.yml

app:
  name: sithex
  user: sithex
```

it's much easier to hardcode these values rather than reference through
variables:

```diff
  - name: Create secrets file
    copy:
      src: "{{ env }}.secret.exs"
      dest: "/var/{{ env }}.secret.exs"
-     owner: "{{ app['user'] }}"
-     group: "{{ app['user'] }}"
+     owner: sithex
+     group: sithex
      mode: 0660
```

it might be not very dry but it doesn't seem to cause any trouble so far.

***UPDATE***

still I continue to use common app variables except for _files/*.secret.exs_
files (note they are not even templates and are not parameterized at all).

### always pass local variables to templates

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/38653180/3632318>

just like when rendering partials in Rails: pass all local variables
explicitly and don't reference global variables inside partials (even
though they will be available there).

`vars` section is used to pass local variables to the template:

```yaml
# roles/sithex_app/tasks/foo.yml

- template:
    src: "foo_{{ env }}.conf"
    dest: "/etc/foo_{{ env }}.conf"
    vars:
      app_name: "{{ app_name }}"
```

***UPDATE***

don't pass `env` as local variable - this leads to recursive loop inside
the template:

```yaml
# roles/sithex_app/tasks/foo.yml

vars:
  env: "{{ env }}" # recursive loop
  app_name: "{{ app_name }}" # OK
```

maybe this is because `env` is a group variable while `app_name` is a role
variable - anyway use `env` variable directly everywhere.

### update package index implicitly with caching

1. <https://github.com/LunarLogic/ansible-elixir-playbooks/blob/master/roles/install_postgresql/0.0.1/tasks/main.yml>

NOTE: package index is known as `apt cache` in Ansible docs:

> <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/apt_module.html>
>
> cache_valid_time
>   Update the apt cache if its older than the cache_valid_time.

```yaml
# roles/common/tasks/packages.yml

# update explicitly
- name: Update package index
  apt:
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
    cache_valid_time: 3600

# [RECOMMENDED] update implicitly
- name: Install common packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
    cache_valid_time: 3600
  loop: "{{ packages }}"
```

environments
------------

1. <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#alternative-directory-layout>
2. <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-multistage-environments-with-ansible#using-ansible-constructs-that-allow-explicit-loading-order>

```yaml
# inventories/prod/group_vars/all

env: prod
```

```yaml
# inventories/stage/group_vars/all

env: stage
```

now `env` variable is available in all plays and roles.
