pack (Webpacker term) == entry (Webpack term)

### notes

#### about environments

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/webpack.md>

<https://github.com/rails/webpacker>:

NODE_ENV values:

- production
- development

assets are compiled in NODE_ENV mode but use/load RAILS_ENV configuration
(production environment is used as a fallback one) from _config/webpacker.yml_.

> binstubs compile in development mode, rake tasks compile in production mode:

```ruby
# compiles in development mode unless NODE_ENV is specified
./bin/webpack
./bin/webpack-dev-server

# compiles in production mode by default unless NODE_ENV is specified
bundle exec rails assets:precompile
bundle exec rails webpacker:compile
```

#### about packs

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/assets.md>

<https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/581#issuecomment-316937091>:

> 'packs' is a special directory meant only for entry files i.e. written either
> in JS, Coffee or TS (as long as it compiles to JS). Every other thing should
> be outside packs and may live under app/javascript or anywhere you wish to
> be as long as you can reference it. If you reference styles in your pack all
> styles will be extracted to [pack_name].css, which you can reference in your
> views.

=> only JS files are allowed to be packs (entries), CSS files imported inside
packs will be extracted into `<pack_name>.css` file which can be referenced in
layout with `stylesheet_pack_tag` helper.

#### about loaders

<https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/webpack.md#loaders>:

> You can also modify the loaders that Webpacker pre-configures for you.

basic loaders are installed as dependencies of `@rails/webpacker` NPM package:

```javascript
// yarn.lock

"@rails/webpacker@3.5":
  version "3.5.3"
  dependencies:
    babel-loader "^7.1.4"
    css-loader "^0.28.11"
    file-loader "^1.1.11"
    postcss-loader "^2.1.4"
    sass-loader "^6.0.7"
    style-loader "^0.20.3"
```

these loaders are also pre-configured by Webpacker (that is rules for loader
modules are added to _webpack.config.js_ Webpack config that must be generated
by Webpacker under the hood).

print `environment.loaders` property inside _config/webpack/environment.js_
for the list of configured loaders:

```diff
  // config/webpack/environment.js

  const {environment} = require('@rails/webpacker');

+ console.log(environment.loaders);
  module.exports = environment;
```

### configuration

#### change source directory

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker#paths>

```diff
  # config/webpacker.yml

  default: &default
-   source_path: app/javascript
+   source_path: app/assets
    source_entry_path: packs
    public_output_path: packs
    cache_path: tmp/cache/webpacker
```

#### import required assets in pack file

```javascript
// app/assets/packs/app.js

import 'css/app';
import 'js/app';
```

#### create Procfile to start development server

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker#development>

> This process will watch for changes in the app/javascript/packs/*.js
> files and automatically reload the browser to match.
>
> Once you start this development server, Webpacker will automatically
> start proxying all webpack asset requests to this server. When you
> stop the server, it'll revert back to on-demand compilation.

```
# Procfile

# for some reason port 5000 is used by default
rails: rails server -p 3000
webpack: bin/webpack-dev-server
```

#### install additional plugins

- `babel-plugin-module-resolver`

  1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/assets.md#using-babel-module-resolver>

  <https://rossta.net/blog/from-sprockets-to-webpack.html#resolving-application-modules>:

  > As a convenience, we learned to resolve modules in our application as import
  > 'some_module' instead of via relative paths like import '../some_module. To
  > do this, we set up an alias in .babelrc. Webpacker installs .babelrc as a
  > separate configuration file for Babel. We added the babel-plugin-module-resolver
  > and updated the relevant section in our .babelrc in the plugins section.

  `babel-plugin-module-resolver` is used to reference assets relative to fixed
  root - say, _app/assets/_:

  ```sh
  $ yarn add babel-plugin-module-resolver
  ```

  ```diff
    // .babelrc

    {
      // ...
      "plugins": [
        "syntax-dynamic-import",
        "transform-object-rest-spread",
  -     ["transform-class-properties", { "spec": true }]
  +     ["transform-class-properties", { "spec": true }],
  +     ["module-resolver", {
  +       "root": ["./app/assets"]
  +     }]
      ]
    }
  ```

  maybe using this plugin is not required since I can reference _css/app.js_
  and _js/app.js_ inside my pack file (_app/assets/packs/app.js_) - that is
  Webpacker understands that these paths are relative to `source_entry_path`
  (_app/assets/_ - see _config/webpacker.yml_) rather than relative to pack
  file.

#### add Sass support

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/css.md>

Sass loader is already installed as dependency of and pre-configured
by Webpacker - no additional configuration is required.

- rename _app/assets/css/app.css_ to _app.sass_ or _app.scss_

  no changes in pack file are required:

  ```javascript
  // app/assets/packs/app.js

  import 'css/app';
  ```

  the point is that Webpacker tries to use all extensions listed in its
  config - just make sure `sass` or `scss` extension is listed there:

  ```yaml
  # config/webpacker.yml

  default: &default
    # ...
    extensions:
      # ...
      - .sass
      - .scss
  ```

- add `resolve-url-loader` package

  1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1267>

  <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/css.md#resolve-url-loader>:

  > Since Sass/libsass does not provide url rewriting, all linked assets
  > must be relative to the output. Add the missing url rewriting using
  > the resolve-url-loader. Place it directly after the sass-loader in
  > the loader chain.

  ```diff
    # config/webpack/environment.js

    const {environment} = require('@rails/webpacker');

  + environment.loaders.get('sass').use.splice(-1, 0, {
  +   loader: 'resolve-url-loader',
  +   options: {
  +     attempts: 1
  +   }
  + });
  ```

  also they say (see the link) URL rewriting is required to import
  Bootstrap with Webpacker.

#### add Bootstrap

1. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/css.md#add-bootstrap>
2. <https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/1267>

first add `resolve-url-loader` package (see above).

```sh
$ yarn add bootstrap
```

```diff
  // app/assets/css/app.scss

+ // ~ to tell that this is not a relative import
+ @import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap'
+ @import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme'
```
