### Futures

```clojure
(defn clean-charts [ds]
  (let [project-name harbor-client/charts-project
        charts (harbor-client/list-charts project-name)]
        call-fn (partial clean-chart-op/call ds project-name)
        ;; https://nurkiewicz.com/2013/03/promises-and-futures-in-clojure.html
        ;; mapv returns realized collection (vector)
        ;; map returns lazy sequence which can be realized with doall
        ;; => (mapv) = (doall (map ...))
        futures (mapv #(future (call-fn (:name %))) charts)]
    ;; Futures throw exceptions only after they are dereferenced
    ;; otherwise exceptions are silenced and won't be seen in log
    (map deref futures)))
```
