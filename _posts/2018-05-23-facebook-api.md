### check if account is prepaid or not

1. <https://www.facebook.com/business/help/105373712886516>

>
> There are two main payment settings for Facebook ads:
>
> Automatic payments: We'll automatically charge you whenever you spend a
> certain amount known as your billing threshold and again on your monthly
> bill date for any leftover costs. This is how you'll pay if you use PayPal
> or most credit and debit cards to purchase ads.
>
> Manual payments: You'll add money to your account first, and then we'll
> deduct from that amount up to once a day as you run ads. This is how you'll
> pay if you use a manual payment method (like PayTM or Boleto BancÃ¡rio) to
> purchase ads. With manual payments, you won't have a billing threshold.
