first steps with docker and troubleshooting.

<!-- more -->

## getting started

### docker-compose

- `docker-compose up -d`

  create and start containers listed in _.docker-compose.yml_
  (pull docker images from docker hub).

- `docker-compose ps`

  list containers (name, command, state, ports):

  ```
         Name                      Command               State           Ports
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  server_app_1          rackup -o 0.0.0.0 -p 4321        Up      0.0.0.0:4321->4321/tcp
  server_db_1           docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      5432/tcp
  ```

  use `-a` option to show all containers (only running containers are shown by default):

  `docker ps -a`

- `docker-compose logs app`

  view output from all containers and from specified container.

  `app` above is a container name:

  - `app` in _.docker-compose.yml_
  - `server_app_1` in `docker-compose ps` output

  use `-f` option to follow log output (= `tail -f`):

  `docker-compose logs -f app`

  use `-t` option to show timestamps:

  `docker-compose logs -t app`

### docker

- `docker images`

  list images.

- `docker ps`

  list containers (container_id, image, command, created, status, ports, names):

  ```
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
  7325284db500        v***n/n**           "rackup -o 0.0.0.0..."   About an hour ago   Up About an hour    0.0.0.0:4321->4321/tcp   server_app_1
  e0ef57d5ac7c        postgres            "docker-entrypoint..."   About an hour ago   Up About an hour    5432/tcp                 server_db_1
  ```

- `docker logs server_app_1`

  same as `docker-compose logs app` but use container name as specified in
  `docker ps` or `docker-compose ps` output.

- `docker build -t <image_name> ./`

  build image from Dockerfile (the latter must be present in CWD).
  it's necessary to rebuild the whole image when you make any changes that
  must be persisted (for `app` container: when you modify ruby source code).

## troubleshooting

### `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?`

just install docker app via `brew cask`.
it's possible to install all necessary docker tools (`boot2docker`, `docker`,
`docker-compose`, etc.) manually but I didn't manage to configure them all
in reasonable time. so it's better to install docker app - it does all the
heavy lifting for you.

`$ brew cask install docker`

don't forget to run docker app after installation
(otherwise docker command might be not available in terminal).
