## upstream

list all local branches and their upstream branches (if any):

```sh
$ git branch -vv
```

say, you create a new branch and push it into remote repository:

```sh
$ git checkout -b foo
$ git push
```

NOTE: if remote repository is not specified, it defaults to `origin`.

this is what happens as a result:

```
$ git branch -avv
  master                d87ad32 [origin/master] misc
* foo                   d87ad32 misc
  remotes/origin/master d87ad32 misc
  remotes/origin/foo    d87ad32 misc
```

- `foo` is created in local repository
- `foo` is created in remote repository
- `origin/foo` is created in local repository
- `foo` doesn't track `origin/foo`

there 2 ways to set upstream:

- for existing branch

  ```
  $ git branch -u origin/foo
  > Branch 'foo' set up to track remote branch 'foo' from 'origin'.
  ```

- for existing or new branch

  1. <https://stackoverflow.com/a/6089415/3632318>

  ```sh
  $ git push -u
  ```

  > So you should supply -u flag on the first push. In fact, you can supply it
