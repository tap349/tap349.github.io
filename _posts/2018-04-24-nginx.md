## notes

### location

- regular expressions (`~` and `~*` modifiers)

  > <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location>
  >
  > Regular expressions are specified with the preceding “~\*” modifier (for
  > case-insensitive matching), or the “~” modifier (for case-sensitive
  > matching).

  > <https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/how-to-configure-nginx/#location-blocks>
  >
  > Just like the server_name directive tells NGINX how to process requests for
  > the domain, location directives cover requests for specific files and
  > folders
  >
  > NGINX always fulfills requests using the most specific match
  >
  > When a location directive is followed by a tilde (~), NGINX performs a
  > regular expression match.
  >
  > If you want matches to be case-insensitive, use a tilde with an asterisk
  > (~\*).

- trailing slash (`/`)

  > <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location>
  >
  > If a location is defined by a prefix string that ends with the slash
  > character, and requests are processed by one of proxy_pass, ..., then the
  > special processing is performed. In response to a request with URI equal to
  > this string, but without the trailing slash, a permanent redirect with the
  > code 301 will be returned to the requested URI with the slash appended. If
  > this is not desired, an exact match of the URI and location could be defined
  > like this:
  >
  > ```
  > location /user/ {
  >     proxy_pass http://user.example.com;
  > }
  > ```

  > <https://serverfault.com/a/870620>
  >
  > Additionally, note that the the trailing / in the location is quite
  > important as well — without it, you risk having weird-looking URLs on your
  > site at one point (e.g., a working /fooen in addition to /foo/en).
  >
  > Additionally, the trailing / in the location with proxy_pass also ensures
  > some special handling, as per the documentation of the location directive,
  > to effectively cause an implicit location = /foo {return 301 /foo/;} as
  > well.

### proxy_pass

- trailing slash (`/`)

  NOTE: trailing `/` in `proxy_pass` directive is also considered to be URI:

  > <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass>
  >
  > If the proxy_pass directive is specified with a URI, then when a request is
  > passed to the server, the part of a normalized request URI matching the
  > location is replaced by a URI specified in the directive:
  >
  > ```
  > location /name/ {
  >     proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1/remote/;
  > }
  > ```

  > <https://serverfault.com/a/870620>
  >
  > trailing slash in proxy_pass ... automatically alters the \$uri variable to
  > have the /foo/ on the front-end correspond with / on the backend. No need
  > for an explicit rewrite directive.

### forward vs. reverse proxy

1. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/224664/difference-between-proxy-server-and-reverse-proxy-server>

> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/366212/3632318>

> What is different this time compared to a "forward proxy", is that this time
> the user X does not know he is accessing Z, because the user X only sees he is
> communicating with Y. The server Z is invisible to clients and only the
> reverse proxy Y is visible externally. A reverse proxy requires no (proxy)
> configuration on the client side.

> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/14190390/3632318>
>
> A proxy is simply a middleman for communication (requests+responses): Client
> <-> Proxy <-> Server
>
> - Client proxy: ( Client <-> Proxy ) <-> Server
>
>   The proxy acts on behalf of the client. Client knows about all 3 machines
>   involved in chain. Server doesn't.
>
> - Server proxy: Client <-> ( Proxy <-> Server )
>
>   The proxy acts on behalf of the server. Client only knows about proxy.
>   Server knows whole chain.
>
> Seems to me that forward and reverse are simply confusing,
> perspective-dependent names for client and server proxy.

## tips

### reload/restart Nginx

for some reason restarting Nginx service using init.d script doesn't work (most
likely `start-stop-daemon` used internally doesn't stop it correctly):

```sh
$ sudo service nginx restart
```

instead it's possible to restart Nginx manually:

- send `reload` signal

  this reloads Nginx configuration only - without restarting service itself:

  ```sh
  $ sudo nginx -s reload
  ```

- or else send `stop` signal and start Nginx service as usual

  ```sh
  $ sudo nginx -s stop
  $ sudo service nginx start
  ```

***UPDATE (2020-07-02)***

I managed to restart Nginx without any problems with command:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
$ sudo journalctl -u nginx
```

### proxy POST requests

1. <https://serverfault.com/a/312114>

POST requests are passed to proxy just like GET requests, no additional
configuration is required.

## troubleshooting

### open() "/etc/nginx/mime.types" failed (2: No such file or directory)

```
$ sudo journalctl -u nginx.service
...
nginx[824]: nginx: [emerg] open() "/etc/nginx/mime.types" failed (2: No such file or directory) in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:25
```

**solution**

```sh
$ sudo apt-get autoremove --purge nginx
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
```

### open() "/run/nginx.pid" failed (2: No such file or directory)

```
$ sudo journalctl -u nginx.service
...
nginx[3257]: nginx: [error] open() "/run/nginx.pid" failed (2: No such file or directory)
```

**solution**

```sh
$ sudo systemctl --system restart nginx
```
