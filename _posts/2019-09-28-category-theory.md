## RATIONALE

That is why would you want to study category theory and why and how it can be
useful to you - future programmers and engineers. Let us be honest - very few of
you will dedicate your life to science. And frankly speaking Tula State
University prepares engineers first of all - not scientists. This is not good
or bad - it's just the way it is.

I want to start with a quote - it's just a comment to YouTube video (BB):

IDK if you realize it now or not - but you need to learn some theory. And not
somewhere in the future but right now. Because you will have no time in the
future to do it thoroughly. You'll get a job, start a family, start jogging,
etc. Your spare time will be decreasing every year. So now is the best time to
learn theory and category theory in particular.

Why category theory? Because you will encounter lots of terms from category
theory in your daily life as software developers. Finally if you opt to learn
and use functional programming languages you will have to deal with a lot of
concepts from category theory. Of course you don't have to know the math to use
some programming primitives but having this knowledge will give you advantage
over you collegues. And you will thank yourself that you spent some time
learning the basics here in the university.

This course will be based on the book and video lectures by Bartosz Milewski. As
you might guess he is some Polish guy judging by his surname. He got his PhD in
Theoretical Physics in Poland. He worked in Microsoft, then founded his own
company, wrote a book "C++ in Action". His interest in C++ template
metaprogramming and concurrency naturally led him to Haskell and then to
category theory. His series of blog posts was converted to the book "Category
Theory for Programmers" which became quite popular. This book is topic of our
course.

IDK whether you are familiar with reading technical literature in English but
IMO it's quite straightforward compared to reading fiction: vocabulary is quite
limited and you will learn most of it after reading, say, the first 50 pages.
This book is no exception. I encourage you to read it by yourself and ask
questions if you have a hard time understanding anything from the book.

The last but the least as the proverb goes - about my motivation. I must have
the one too. Of course the money I get by giving this course of lectures is no
motivation - I guess you understand it. First of all I'm interested and highly
motivated to learn the basics of category theory by myself - even though I
encounter its concepts quite often I have never found time to study the theory
behind them. This is the very lack of time I was talking about. You know how it
happens - you always have a long list of books (TODO list) of books to read. In
you next life ) Because in current life you are too busy making other more
important things. So I want to solidify my knowledge of this topic by myself
because the best way to learn anything is to try to explain it to someone else -
to you in this case :)

Also I'd like to clarify that I am neither professional teacher or professional
scientist - I am a professional software developer. That is I earn my living by
writing programs in different programming languages. That is why that is why you
might know many things better than me because I studied them many years ago
while you are studying right now. Probably the one thing I know better than most
of you is English. though itâ€™s also not perfect of course )
