mc tips and troubleshooting.

<!-- more -->

## mc is slow when switching panes

the problem is related to using subshell support (concurrent shell support).

to disable it run mc with `--nosubshell` (`-u`) option but in this case
_~/.zshrc_ is not sourced and consequently all cd aliases are not available.

having huge _~/.zsh_history_ might also slow things down (especially at startup).
